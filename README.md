Phrase-based MT Assignment
Hello Everyone,
 
We have made baselines and sample code available for the second assignment on the web page here:
http://phontron.com/class/mtandseq2seq2017/
 
Basically, the assignment is to create a phrase-based translation system, but some of the surrounding framework (n-gram language modeling and decoding) is already there so you can focus on creation of the actual phrase-based system. Here are the things that need to be done:

* IBM Model 1
* phrase-extract
* Creation of a WFST from the phrases
* The addition of one (or more) improvements
 
The baseline system with no improvements that uses phrases of length up to three achieves a BLEU score of 17.98 on the test set, so this is one number to aim for.
 
As always, the TAs and me will be happy to answer any questions, so please feel free to ask early and ask often!
 
Graham
