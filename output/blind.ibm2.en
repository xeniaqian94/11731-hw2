yes , good day mean , ladies , gentlemen .
so thank you for the invitation here today to talk .
and i have to me , now , imagine .
my name is christian <unk> and i am , weird thing , <unk> at the city of food .
this is called <unk> for eight years .
and my <unk> is : one personnel , the organization , and thirdly , the public policy .
so i 'm for the <unk> this city , responsible .
and yes , so you do n't be admired .
i know .
and beyond this , and this is something which my son , especially cut down , i 'm also <unk> .
that means that i 'm the head of the <unk> pole .
<unk> <unk> and half <unk> .
and , i think , is , of a subject matter , with what i do you today <unk> want .
because with the subject of <unk> , because again , it belongs to the firemen .
we hope to the best and us ready to the worst of that 's what jack , what once said .
you know him .
he was once in general <unk> .
and then i start something not so serious enough to say .
i <unk> you a precarious situation .
so we talk , if it sort of a risk is that we just before a stand for example , <unk> perpendicular to an hour .
many people are the way .
it is , it <unk> to .
and somewhere on the is a suitcase , lonely , leaving , something <unk> , maybe the military towers with you .
nobody seems to belong .
the suitcase 's no .
suddenly a <unk> .
leave you that <unk> .
the police comes , what firemen , <unk> .
people scream .
officials <unk> .
go out there .
what 's because this ? , ask passersby .
that we know it or we can tell you .
the people leave the building .
so to cry .
some other perhaps even , because it all very quickly going to .
suddenly a myth .
there 's <unk> inside .
a panic is breaking out .
i am now here on .
the rest leave me your imagination .
but it 's no fantasy , that i <unk> have . <unk> ?
that 's going on in this week is happening in like dusseldorf .
there 's such a suitcase 're stacking them .
afterwards they turned out that only , in <unk> , nine , one of crack in it was .
but the people were just so , and that has a friend told me that tells , from the building negotiation .
it was not joking .
and there was that myth and all at least in the group on that my friend in my friend , i found myself .
thank you is n't panic <unk> , otherwise would all this was n't that lies in theater as well , you .

communication is that 's important , because the people in this situation where you almost to communicate <unk> .
they want to know , which is because it .
i used in the good , ancient times was that for the authorities , pretty simple .
we 've just ca n't have said , or we 've got lied .
why ?
because the so-called <unk> there .

this is in a time the social media , in a time of twitter , in a time of facebook , in a time by private and public broadcasters , in a time of <unk> and public tv , no longer possible .
just come and intense that 's because it first is not a morally , and secondly , mostly are going to reach the past when food , the about this incident in yugoslavia .
so if you may even shouting at the passenger in the hudson river , it 's a year , and forth .
the first to report that came with twitter .
someone reading , the on a ferry over , and just come and intense in fact , `` , here 's an airplane you can and we save the people now .
it was not <unk> .
you see , we 're dependent on , these simple and emotional position of the truth to say , and a minor modifications to inform .
because usually we 're obviously also the past , the prison on the truth , because we had to criticize you have of course , to pay attention that we just <unk> information to pass .
it 's public media , or as private media , either not so what happened or they 're just not too .
of so , we 're going to eat , and that 's also something that 's gone on through the media has gone are , we think about how we in the future with <unk> deal .
and we 're the good old raid , it .
but just as a form of <unk> .
it means we 're in the next few years ago or a hundred raid , in the <unk> build that , some of you know that , <unk> , if it just for <unk> comes .
things used it .
they may know you know yet , which are three times in short , once in short , again and even just means .
i know it 's no longer .
we 're that these spaces with all <unk> , we looked at this point , so <unk> , on facebook , on twitter , over the radio <unk> too late night , over the tv and at all over the internet and the local media and so forth and immediately , connected , of with <unk> , to end of the information to get .
and we know , we need to there 's very quickly and making modifications to and we need to there 's very quickly and making modifications , policy , because the to re-educate ourselves and citizens are otherwise we agreed .
and we ultimately , you do n't think that , what we tell you want .
communication in the crisis , or in the disaster is so on a question to speed of all media that we have available to , and it 's also a question to the credibility .
the credibility that 's our biggest problem , because the to re-educate ourselves and citizens to say , either , oh , the proportion , once again , it 's not , or they say , the <unk> us , it 's all very much worse than it 's actually .
we have therefore as good at things done with facebook and twitter , more recently .
and that you may have some of things with the media from .
we have a <unk> to eat <unk> had .
and it 's a chemical bomb .
this is that strap bombs that with a <unk> , are , because they are supposed to take some of the first <unk> on the <unk> explode , it by the houses in the world war <unk> and just at the ground , because of a chemical response , the analogies that is that a metal , the second <unk> two <unk> of each separated , that , <unk> , and then came to put it explodes .
this problem is just , many of the suitcase bombs 've never works and they 're looking like to the <unk> among them into food <unk> .
and we were from an elderly gentleman that would be a conscience , how he 's got to say , said , smooth , we were now , he had seen as you <unk> forty-three plummeted , and now <unk> he 's the authorities to be misinformed , there is that a bomb up . he started the back ,
by having to have a couple of the older , the play around the <unk> .
we 'll see , what else we find everything .
these suitcase bombs need immediately of local , not a bomb , but it blew up .
and so we 've played in <unk> park , which simply and intense an , in every sense of the word , a bomb be well .
and the first time in the history of the entire communicate via facebook and twitter , let it run with the consequence that the entire <unk> far above <unk> <unk> to be followed these are .
and the media was thrilled . he started in the background .
we had n't even with the purposes , but they have <unk> and <unk> , all over <unk> and twitter .
that all had a great effect for us , because the credibility that 's found is increased about these social media .
just so , they have to me as a sign that are , when i 'll stop is .
i can go from this is not at the watch a little bit .
this is the credibility that , because the first of these social media , the advantage we have that you very much information to pass .
not so <unk> are , because the community of the there are tweeting right the <unk> , as you call them , a high <unk> have .
secondly , very fast , our boards .
if anything 's not true , writes that as anyone responded immediately , so that the credibility that , of the i 've talked about , which goes up , because of the entire community in principle to receive a particular is .
and it 's a very high <unk> therefore , so if anything that 's wrong , then it can also very quickly and you will .
and we have a huge <unk> .
i said yes , <unk> that this thing to find indeed , as a bomb on the <unk> park to go .

and the city of food , every day of such a home and looking to be .
a bomb that in scale to be in a park that 's certainly not such a .
but you can also , and then <unk> we now , in <unk> be found and then i am , we see there with our <unk> and try to give in seven meters deep <unk> .
and if they said , you think in munich , you think about other cities , if they said that blew up going to , because you just something called a <unk> , the you take conventional or not your toddler can , then we know already now , be a variety of houses each and n't like that look like before .
and that to communicate it 's important , one hand , because it just in a in a world is rapidly <unk> rate is necessary , communication to run , you to panic now inevitable , to worry too long , that the human information is to get to worry too long , that the human being able to are , to these difficult situation .
and the social media to help us out , believable , to be , because ultimately , they all of the communications are involved , and it 's not just a one-page summary <unk> is how we play in the <unk> , <unk> and certainly , even in the <unk> a lot of my bike lanes .
it 's why is now , as not just a job to the authorities , not just a job to the firemen , or the <unk> , of <unk> , the <unk> , red cross etc. , etc , but of communication in the catastrophe and help of a 's all of us to .
and <unk> this has been .
there 's on twitter , and on facebook , a lot of the help the time , if you also partially destroys you still so it was , because suddenly <unk> of people working with <unk> and then just wanted , and you did n't even more , where the <unk> are .
this shows , there 's a lot to do , the case of communication in <unk> , but the unprecedented amount of solidarity with the <unk> and the around has just demonstrated that the social media from a <unk> , from a communication to do n't even more way to think there are .
and i hope that i make a little of 've convinced that this media , this is supposed to the things of life often be used to , even in <unk> its meaning and purpose in fulfilling and that we as a city , the for the of war , as in charge is , this instrument we going to be a really new and a different place worth it 's going to her , to the citizens to use the to re-educate ourselves and citizens and so the end , i now , and , i 'm very much for your attention , even if i the entire time , i 've seen .
thank you .
so , a beautiful good evening .
i 'm <unk> different .
i 'm a writer and <unk> , like you just 've heard .
and i 'm now , even in fact , with a <unk> of reasons .
what it is that there i <unk> produce , that i 'll show you also in front .
before i do that , i must but a few things <unk> .
the first is , , i believe that we make sure enough to live longer need .
that 's no stories about it could live .
and i believe that it 's very much more <unk> , <unk> , <unk> stories are , as of the entertainment , indeed will be produced .
then i think , that the internet , the infinite , from , actually as well no <unk> really nice , <unk> will .
and fourth , i 'm <unk> of confident that people that were created , to be creative .
and that they become happier , once you can be creative , anywhere .
ever more people are happy , the better , it 's the world .
it logically .
these better world is now just a byproduct .
in primarily i am , how we 've been told , a storyteller .
and the story that i tell me , starting to midnight poised in a bar , in just happy <unk> put it will .
this is <unk> .
and it 's <unk> <unk> birthday .
now , they climbed the congratulating and the singing , did not so much with , because in the moment , where it strikes midnight 's become , something happens with her .
it 's something in your mind , in your body , with their perception .
and she did n't real word for .
they do n't know , what 's just happened .
i 've actually word for .
i call that the wizard of <unk> .
you see on the one hand <unk> and do in <unk> and everything is pretty stark white .
i 've ever felt that i am somehow felt pretty <unk> .
<unk> .
and on the other hand , we 've got the two in the country of oz -- in a very much color .
and it was to do that once told that i 'd better <unk> and write , when i used to record .
so , the first , what <unk> now with their new perceptions , is a stranger , man with <unk> <unk> hair , the front of her , you very seriously at , and says , congratulations , your life is over .
this is <unk> .
and <unk> enlightens <unk> about it at that they tend to a very special kind of people heard .
she was as <unk> born .
are people , the off your <unk> , for their lifetime , games have .
of you who knows <unk> ?
very beautiful .
so now , before , the immortal in <unk> not plastic , if you go together meeting , but <unk> from the pocket .
so a cube , <unk> , <unk> , anything possible .
what really matter , the players have no insight into their play .
we know as well , not , when we die .
i wish to make a long life , but we know how do n't fit .
it can make tomorrow also all going to be .
and consequently , it 's in my players to be .
they do n't actually , about how does it actually can play .
that means , again , and lost full minute , the last to be .
a gamer , the entire lifetime , playful enough , <unk> the moment of <unk> like a candle that <unk> will .
now , this can of course , if that because this is dangerous , why games and then i mean ?
the answer is very clearly : that .
without play , without any players to an engineer , <unk> , gray , and just as a gamer is , he 's actually alive .
they were to play an abomination .
so .
this story of <unk> and as you now the world of gamers <unk> , to your first of challenge is , and of course , going to <unk> love , this is the story that i tell me .
and it 's in form of a <unk> .
the first slate has 12 to follow , sorry , i am here 's a <unk> happens , the i just too late 've seen .
so , 12 , in the first slate , with a depth of each spent five or seven minutes .
this kind of <unk> , an outcome after the other , you <unk> told that you know .
that television is for his <unk> nothing else .
this is not new .
and if it all be , then about getting tired , i now , first projects .
and what 's not at here .
now is it , but it off to .
let 's more time to <unk> back .
what 's the most famous game up in the film , or from a series ?
it can only to give , right .
thanks .
as if we practiced that would .
and that is true for my players , which is not too .
of which is it 's plenty of giving .
there are so many different games .
you think of <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> and so forth and so on .
and that <unk> 's also the number of gamers .
and grow over here a lot of stories that all be told you want .
now is the next question : who 's that because it all share ?
i 've ever been a very high think of me .
i think give me for are smart and the most creative .
but i know that 's a hundred brains to produce as the only thing , even if it 's mine is .
so , it directly to the idea that you the crowd , with in the process of itself .
what would , if we <unk> not just how do n't give yourself , but even <unk> ?
so if you say , we invite you very very much a , the development of this <unk> with environmental problem .
so now , before , for example , in a kind of three , a <unk> on , the she totally messed up , because he would you for example of her grandfather was reminded me .
moreover , it 's a big fan of <unk> .
and now you can just , with the present technology is that does n't even more so hard , a <unk> do .

that is , it 's not anywhere among , but it lands automatically be right there , where it up to .
this really nice thing is that we the internet is .
and the internet , you ca n't really do anything .
so , every medium is kind of makeup .
it means you as viewers , you can write , drawing , turn , whatever they do want .
and if we also now , do this structure through .
it looks <unk> bit of <unk> net , right ?
so this <unk> , which together , who will .
and i 'm really <unk> believe that , that the internet was born , in fact that kind of stories to tell .
it just doing it 's not so many , and more , no one .
so , i go , ' i but even one step further and i 'm going to audiences express ourselves to the players are .
because in a <unk> .
there 's what to top characters from the show up , but also discriminate against people in the real world that we saw these <unk> on your cellphone has .
<unk> , and you know that i 'm also all very well , is something of mobile <unk> and <unk> <unk> entertainment .
this wonderful designs that 's just very rapidly evolve .
and on the i do n't tell you can , because someone else i went back 20 minutes i would need .
we conceive of all together .
everybody 's time i did this consists of three parts .
the first part is the <unk> , the second part is the <unk> and then we do this <unk> .
with this <unk> i could this before the jury of that moment , i have that a function , the <unk> innovation <unk> convince them .
they are having me as the price for the best business plan .
and i have to say , the jury , which consisted of officials from the banks , of the <unk> , <unk> and so forth .
so you people , would you believe .
and when i 'm going to convince you can , here with my : the internet to use , <unk> to revolutionize , incidentally , even better world , then i think , i can actually anyone to convince them .
so .
everybody 's just play fires : why does it matter because now that ?
because it alone in this names all sectors , and make-up , will .
we have of course of the <unk> , who 's tough , it 's my , you go off , everybody 's a good .
and then that die .
in the pbs series of it 's very much died .
everybody 's going to cut off , which means everybody has to die .
and then , as well , everybody 's going to cut off in terms of everyone can be part , when he 'd like .
this is me totally good .
i 'll get tired from the <unk> and there 's nothing worse in my opinion , as if it 's a <unk> will .
i do n't know , if you know .
if you in the theater , and then it 's an actor , so in the auditorium and everybody agrees : oh god , please do n't let me .
and this is it right .
so it 's kind of interaction .
and nobody has .
he can also just people to be .
the reason why i deutsch , about is the that the entire project , even in german will be , put them .
it 's also a few reasons .
i 'm looking at this project <unk> while flying and i was again and wondered : go the way , but in english , demographic : larger , <unk> <unk> <unk> .
and i can just say , the german <unk> is the third of the world .
the <unk> is the english , then it 's spanish , and then the german .
now it 's not so , like we 're at any little niche move .
furthermore think i really actually really , if it also other people that 's like me that the people to be grateful , for something that 's not by any <unk> <unk> , where the end , then everybody <unk> and each of wordplay <unk> was drawn .
if that everything that 's one , i it would have , then goes to the result now on the first was <unk> online .
and if you 're now , why i because now i 'm here in a <unk> , where it gets under the headline <unk> worth <unk> process .
and i 've also a few ideas .
i love <unk> .
not just <unk> .
i 'm also kind depend on <unk> and <unk> .
a few <unk> were out and <unk> .

but it uses , everything would n't know , if you do not flies .
and my project is just <unk> thing where i just going away everything , what i so i 've learned .
and it was exposed to have .
and they have been doing okay .
i can really just say .
so , so whenever somebody you go , i 'd have been my bit about , i had 19 degrees ' one idea <unk> character or i 've ever seen can you 've <unk> cartoon , or whatever that 's also now it .
you find us in the internet .
on facebook .
well , as freely in the speaker to talk .
yes , love ' i also .
welcome to , you can reactivate memories are ?
question , to you
you can reactivate memories are ?
you assume , because at all remember , what to your life ever 's happened ?
you have a <unk> mention ?
who has who can even shouting at all remember that ?
it 's not hands up .
so you can reactivate memories are ?
apparently been .
thank you .
no , just like that we want to make us to do n't do .
and then i would be the talk , probably fairly quickly .
again a good evening , my name is samuel <unk> .
the talk about tonight , the , i chose , because they’re two of my passions , or my two great love down at connecting .
i 've ever seen over here in the closeness of computer , studied and i 've ever seen me just with the bits and of bytes of doing that nowadays this tall by the world to fly .
and <unk> certain time , i also as a coach , and adviser during the private and professional capacity to solve the way .
on the one hand , i got so with the with the computer , much less concerned , on the other hand , i 'm doing right thing in the into human <unk> <unk> <unk> , so what is that one that the human beings ?
what about that change ?
the to a comparison opposition .

so , the question was : when we can , when , when we can build a computer , the that 's like the human brain ?
so , and i believe that 's because we 've gotten pretty close .
so i think , so two , three hundred years , no longer does n't do that .
but let me to do , why you that 's why that maybe <unk> some recovery needs .
so the analogy between the computer on the one hand and our brains in the other hand .
if we the computer taking , then is yes , and so your smartphone that you a tablet , you <unk> and these cameras and all of all these smart refrigerators -- somewhere on <unk> little chip .
he 's going , central <unk> operations .
these pieces here 's composed of tiny , transistors .
the word , you’re going to know anyone heard and in <unk> it will always like a triangle that .
this <unk> little device that has three to add , and shuts down this current flowing through , or not .
in our computer in our cpu , we have , i 've ever seen the <unk> about five hundred million of little parts .
and get there clamors to mess .
we 're doing things , we we can calculate that we have degrees ' i just a 36-year-old albert einstein said , listen , yes , 'n computer can all can be very much , very quickly , but he can just zero and one , compare .
and he ca n't .
he 's actually quite <unk> .
we want to get on the time you compare with our brains .
our brains , as the smallest unit of the neuron , the neuron , and we 've learned about , there too , i was <unk> , a hundred billion , a hundred billion neurons are in our gray matter , up here is inside .
this beautiful but is , our quality of neurons have not only three fundamental connections , but they needed to <unk> each neuron .
and that makes a <unk> <unk> of , just because it 's beautiful , is about 10 trillion .
that are 10 to 14 zeroes <unk> .
so , because you see on the complexity of the brain is about a higher than that , what we 're now , when computers have .
we want to the <unk> time you compare that perhaps the one or other , of , the first supercomputer that had their own power door , ha , the cluster , and with the of its the <unk> was the campus <unk> <unk> .
our <unk> skit even sometimes , but the box up here it takes about 20 watts .
and of course , and this is that 's the equivalent of two big selling bananas , so more you do n't and you your calculators up there 's wonderful .
if we now <unk> a giant good part up here , <unk> giant tree are able to <unk> , why we use to do n't , why we remember that we then things ?
maybe if you know the one or another this out in the internet , so , the person using only 10 percent of the brain , buy it now this <unk> to <unk> brain to be .
and <unk> because they 're wrong , the commercials , a little .
ten percent , perhaps , but our brain is over the our evolution of mass cell that , yes <unk> smaller , in the middle of us is still our <unk> in , everything else has <unk> .
that 's certainly do n't happen , because we do n't that we use .
why does it is that we the most part of <unk> let me ?
maybe you know , the notion of the unconscious minds ?
of i compared ' heels of whatever it 's got to the iceberg , if you the iceberg , in the ocean , then , is that 's top so the top , then comes the surface , bottom of it 's a <unk> .
and these 10 percent up , this is that 's about this , what we make a , our thinking of mind is , <unk> going , but those percent , is a giant <unk> , square .
we <unk> the point of that we <unk> we <unk> we <unk> we <unk> <unk> slow <unk> we <unk> creative .
and that to time <unk> on this enduring memories come back , maybe if you know that one or other people with <unk> memory .
people that , suddenly appeared to a lot more detail can remember when i did n't seen , ' in the situation square , and tell you <unk> , i 've ever said yes , but yes , but , where you know that ?
this is , there are very , it 's a particular , called a <unk> , so someone with <unk> , somebody 's mostly in a field <unk> , the excellent , who has a so good <unk> memory , who 's been on an airplane , around , in a plane , in a helicopter , so fast is nothin ' he tries e : ow 's not , over rome effectively went , has to rome to view , so rome that is so here : ow 's not necessarily the smallest one city , has been inundated with a gigantic , signs were discarded , and has started , rome to draw .
and it 's not a way , so here , so the river , and there is that 's that , no , every single house , every single door , every one eyebrow windows has he once seen , he <unk> , it could go back to pairs of them .
how do is now that ?
so why is the that , why we can not , well , the thought that 's probably quite close that the <unk> bit more access in its own those percent of hanging out .
now we 're using the as well , but why can i do n't comply with the <unk> last night , remember , in the details of ?
'n friend , <unk> of mine has to the interesting things done .
he has to reason for example , in the law enforcement work and has a <unk> worked , who had her experience is completely eliminated that was no longer time , that <unk> <unk> the brain , this is n't happen , that 's gone .
well , so , the very clear .
now , it , but that the people <unk> to do .
there 's what they were in a very safe to be , at the end or after this event as well , even if you , no longer alive and remember that we could , she was then the hallmark of cars can see , where these people <unk> , that was n't <unk> , that was coming meters on .
and indeed , with the hallmark of the top , caught up .
the second thing i a great thing that i thought , he has a lady in <unk> had that has told that her mother always embarrass her to alice in wonderland , it 's when they 're small , so four years .
there was it on the womb of your mom and her mother has been reading .
and then he did you said , in a trance , then create but the time ago .
then she was starting in textbooks , she was four days when they have that is , they could then let 's not reading , today , this .
and then you have said , he said , tell me to the <unk> .
they 've actually a specimen from alice in wonderland , they found , where that on this side of text it said , the the lady it 's .
the brain , so this page as she was <unk> , as a picture .
and she could read .
so yes , we 've actually retained access to that , but we seem to because the normal life 's say <unk> kind <unk> to have to get around us not to <unk> .
now , that we do n't that event , in fact , but how <unk> have said , he has a a a picture i saw , a , a a <unk> , we 're yes , in our experiences , so that , what we see , this , what we smell , that , what we hear that , what we taste and that , what we feel , hey , if you 're now <unk> in a yellow lemon think and as you know that , right <unk> <unk> , you <unk> sense , like of smoking tastes , very popular example .
and , it was now <unk> long ago , guten abend , put them , but <unk> comfortable down , ha , <unk> little upright and , then i must ask you , therefore , you , but just a your eyes .
and remember to a very good experience , the usual case in recent past , yes .
you take the first , what happens .
and , if you 're doing , you might notice that you to this memory of a visual part of elevator .
they get , maybe a picture , maybe as a movie ?
some that we lose that , do n't on , because we think that normally do , but we do you first time i realized that .
and if you see , then it can be that they 're either in the movie , from their eyes , all experience , or how they come to see on a canvas .
that it 's call <unk> , the other <unk> .
thank you , they 're allowed the idea to solve , degrading the eyes peering back up .
who has been a graphical information , one hand up ?
yes , there , but <unk> 's a few hands up , that 's so , 'n two-thirds or so i would say , yes , that 's about this , what i expected , it 's it 's actually something that we so often do that it 's the first moment n't think .
well , ' <unk> on .
<unk> what it is beautiful rings up in memories , if you memories <unk> , yes , not just this memory in high , <unk> <unk> feeling that we <unk> a positive that event and i 've ever seen the one or other babies smile can see , there was so , that was beautiful , there were , yes , they laugh , and it 's the memory , maybe even there , in fact that we do with memory fades as beautiful or other feelings and down .
and this is what 's exciting .
<unk> anything before , yes , well , the our brain power of the point no difference between what we actually reminded , and the , what we just imagine , what we have conceived .
and that you can try out , if you look at home <unk> down and a bit in the future , imagine that 's not happening is , they 're similar information about how do something , if you something to remember , what the past was .
and that , you know what you’re seeing these stories that you that tells the situation round , of time .
then , hey , there is that happens , and that , and that was so beautiful , and ever known for those stories behind , beautiful , mostly the stories , hey , there were the people such a drunk , there was the evening , such a situation , there was the sun set a lot more romantic , there was the waterfall is still much higher .
if we 're in the mean , so if we really our memories that change , why we doing this because not take action , i asked them ?
<unk> , when i came , has crossed my uncle is a picture is , of his hut and in switzerland .
a very nice image , it 's also a beautiful hut .
just , this picture is that 's <unk> bit more than the shack , so it 's artistic depiction of freedom , he tells me , but there 's the shack <unk> some footage , there is that 's 'n bit more gras by it , there 's a beautiful dog that , because the outside the sun in the alps , this is quite a picture of floors , n't turn into operational budgets .
and why we doing this because not with our own thoughts , our own memories , hey , and that bothers me of because , sometimes i even more fun doing , at what i know that , who think ?
they 've actually being artistic depiction of freedom within their own thoughts .
<unk> you know , so some people that you see the morning , if you just so the gray have eyes , which is because this ?
yes . i 've ever seen terrible student taking , i went on the whole <unk> through the head .
really all the night and this idea made me to go .
i think it 's around the he planted the idea not going .
the son <unk> friend of me <unk> little depressed , when he to germany was , because his mother in <unk> introverted and he did you just awful to .
what the father has done , so he has to each night with her son , he would say , and has said , or has been asking , so , which was that most beautiful , which today 's happened ?
what was that most beautiful , and tell time , and then he 'll tell , it was <unk> , it was just tell , which today , very nice happens is .
and , within two weeks went on the son 're doing .
and then it was ok , that ma , way is that is yes , back to visit .
and this is today , who has that all the age of the only done with , who is today one of <unk> people that i know .
so these are not the memory that we do , in the way that we are , but it 's our focus on , our focus on the idea that we use .
and how much energy we put them or use .
so if you <unk> <unk> thought <unk> or say , that , now here : ow , that 's so , square that practice of fairness and i really not , then make them to tase me just like , you know , tom cruise walk in this <unk> fiction movies , he has this , that these <unk> computer , where he <unk> <unk> <unk> , do it , but also time , you look for her image that <unk> have about this , well , not so you have a , they say , yes , well , <unk> now <unk> happening now , bam , way that .
so ham , we because <unk> ' yet , ah , what i mean , yes , i look at what 's there , <unk> , yes , that 's got me <unk> 's really enjoyed , gee , that was that was beautiful , yeah ?
and then take them , but that time with .

or if you know somebody <unk> really , square , whether it 's <unk> of their boss , or your wife , or her husband , <unk> , and they <unk> .
so , take you here as the image , put them <unk> funny hat on , hey .
<unk> <unk> <unk> with <unk> , let the back , horses jump , yes , they laugh , why they will laugh ?
because they <unk> imagine , because of thinking funny , are .
and you can better off with the situation , all variations .
ca : man , memories so , ?
no , i think our brain has been so much of capacity that there anything that can .
it does , but nothing , because we can go to vote , how strong that we could focus and how important thing we have an event , a memory , an idea to evaluate them , it comes up at us .
i 've spoken in you , you , they play with the images in your mind , they use the power of the unconscious and they give him every day <unk> that pummel their lives , enrich themselves .
yes , the good afternoon .
thanks for the invitation .
if i in a party ever wondered , what i so in my hands every time and tell that i worked with friends , a <unk> get organized and make , then i see is shining eyes and in the minds of the listener to own connotation of it back to clear , <unk> , <unk> and <unk> come up .
if i then <unk> that it 's looking at the film festival by a film festival in classical music is , and push a bit like this back to clear picture of old people that in now , long <unk> in <unk> throw rocks sit and very focused on the art , listen .
frank zappa once said , about music to talk is so how about architecture to dance .
and have that is that also with what we do .
so they still a window , what i wanted to speak , i 've got a short film with me .
film .
there is <unk> 'n <unk> it .
that puts it in my view the best in the point .
since <unk> growing the <unk> from the <unk> lust , something completely different to do .
we makers have today , so forth between eighteen , and the middle , the end of 20 old and i have an early in our youth who , which has tremendous force and delight us that classical music a .
now we 're also seen that the conventions of <unk> and of <unk> us there some happiness , a little or crowd can .
and we are the absolutely convinced that 's called the crisis the classical music , not at the content , so on the music downloads himself , but in your <unk> lies .
so we imagine the question , how we have a <unk> , that the music , the near that are friends and these are -- again , that we are so dependent on her like .
how we can make a <unk> organize that beyond the conventions of <unk> work ?
we put the parameter fitting that you from the classic concert , space , time , light , the context , basically in the question .
so take for example of the relationship between the audience and musicians .
usually , there 's between the stage and the audience a gap .
we 're trying to the effect .
this is a picture of our <unk> .
the musician is sitting in the audience , drink beer , talking to be going to the middle to me with the audience , standing on , play a , two pieces , put up again in the audience .
this is the course of the night a little <unk> .
everybody , the notion that has <unk> , come on the stage and goes back .
or , sitting in the concert .
in classical , concert and it 's so that you on more or less of comfortable , you really designing chairs , like this way , sit and then in front and look , and listening .
but there 's music , because you ca n't actually sit still .
and we thought , which made , how you can use .
if you do n't sit and to pose an <unk> piece of music <unk> , then hear them automatically degrade the way .
still socialized to come out that we the concert does n't a stage , but four stages and entertain the way around .
the audience could be yes <unk> .
so i sat on the night every once in the front .
to us is that we 're not just any events , but that we of the music from thinking .
that we ask is that have well-protected spaces and the atmospheres around , but also in the minds of the human needs the music that they so , are we can see how they do is ?
and then they performing at night around <unk> at 30 kilometers in <unk> , the s 's actually just by <unk> enlighten , in clubs , on <unk> , in the old <unk> .
but not just the spaces around it and the illumination can listen to life will let and now , but also the connection with other arts .

and then they <unk> for <unk> of design or for <unk> by steve the realm .
and in this year , let 's a , yes , if you so let me , <unk> complete .
we have the first time a concert she combined with a <unk> implemented .
we have the story from the soldiers of <unk> <unk> with actors , attached , <unk> and just <unk> a <unk> christmastime .
it 's kind of that as well , because we have a major <unk> , the us in this piece of funding has .
we have a <unk> much money from people out of germany , it was so that we do this campaign did .
at is this film festival something that from a community figured out to form .
we 're totally happy inside of here <unk> in the town <unk> a home country to have .
the city is just as big that we have been great spaces and exciting place for performing , and so small that we notice .
if the beginning of the year in the spring , two weeks forty <unk> from all of europe in the city , then drops on just that in the city , more people with <unk> around as you normally .
this film festival , volunteering that organized .
we makers have a want you mix of students and students , medical professionals , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , really , be totally up .
and around a <unk> a <unk> <unk> that the <unk> or a coordination , and funding in your eye you keep , <unk> to seven or 10 makers in a <unk> that lasts for a year compulsory tasks are .
it 's also the volunteering , but you care , for a year that for example that <unk> or the <unk> , the <unk> into permanent being , and to the film festival , we do you will .
we do all in our hands and live in all of germany .
that most of the work , <unk> and on a <unk> .
just three times a year we make us about this year and distributed to an extended weekends , brainstorming , to go into the one or other problems that has come tumbling , and that matters too , this interpersonal each other thing that is just amazing thing is , if you something that in motion , i want .
the film festival by coming then i would have to 30 voluntary organizations , for that , for a few days or a few weeks , your table , and touch , where the way that 's needed , in <unk> , in <unk> , in <unk> , in <unk> .
and of in that 's 14 days , the musician to .
now you could mean , so we have anything you for such a film festival , needs .
but our <unk> 's still further .
we 've actually in <unk> in the city is a whole community around us , built some sense that we can be supported in the what we want to do .
it goes from the classical <unk> go , and that 's but also about very practical things like for example , the board , there 's a baker , the us to make <unk> or a <unk> , who 's fresh food available to imagine .
this <unk> is in a noble , in the city and over the entire year was done , and sells .
to the <unk> .
we have in <unk> a whole series to have found that 's your room to provide , with the musicians and being able to .
and on this kind of ways , is that israel festival in some of his own in this city has become and from the people in this town .
they relate to be a very special kind of ways , with this film festival .
since the beginning of the year , we did you <unk> this by the citizens of local an <unk> to live out that now the entire endeavor in a <unk> and reliable <unk> turns .
we makers , from the stage , believe that classical music to be rock'n -- that provided you come in the right hands .
therefore we 're incredibly excited about that throughout europe young musicians played music in your hand go and home to be in the cities <unk> craft .
if they 're still not so just imagine , how does it feels , classical music that to experience , then they come , but just over .
but starting next year we 're back in <unk> and we would be delighted , if you then you 're there .
yes , ladies and gentlemen , learn .
you think it may know him .
we know that belongs to be able to learn , or the effect of learning , but i mean , for learning is a lot more , which is also <unk> <unk> <unk> collecting and <unk> win .
you know , with an experience of time <unk> , a nice about formula for the <unk> .
what i made of art and culture , i 've learned , well , because i can be a lot of course , to say , because now , set be <unk> i mean , in this field .
and so , i think that it might be able to be , this is something <unk> called a different <unk> yet to give , what my talk <unk> .
art is beautiful , power , but my work .
they 've now you laugh .
you always the laughter , despite the most of all know .
why is that ?
i think that has to do with that in the word you something <unk> , what we do n't really quite capture the quest .
art critics say that we even sometimes , that 's what .
to work we 're saying that time , that 's what .
even sometimes .
the people that looked like to work that 's what to me .
but at work , we think of the <unk> and the art of the rich , beyond one of everyday life , where we look in moving , our experience of dna , our own thoughts .
and so i 've got my <unk> , the i tell you out , in about three hours in five different sections shared that all the rubric , with a i of the beginning , so it for them just is .
it starts with the <unk> , for the whole childhood , goes on the inspiration , for my youth , i 'm not all tell from my youth , n't worry , then go further , the word age-grade i 'm going to read , why i do it to <unk> actually have .
the interaction of the first part of my professional life and finally , fifth , positive identification .

<unk> , two , and <unk> .
you learn this comes in the first two , three years , if you are somewhat practices , and i 've gotten somewhat practicing .
and so with 10 , 11 , i have these little pieces of the ground , on the piano , not far from here , at the <unk> , at home .
these pieces of life of a <unk> .
there 's a melody and coupons and the other voice <unk> , but it 's very differently .
the rhythm is the brain , but it 's <unk> .
and that , ladies and gentlemen , is something crucial in the art that it succeeds , and if you only two votes are , <unk> together , together to think if that the present , the future , the past , sometimes , in the beginning , images , in <unk> , in movies , things that <unk> are , for the moment to put together , the art makes enough .

this was , what i was so i 've learned , among them .
another experience i 've never forget and i was the job anyway , it to me today may be here 's how could .
i have the piano <unk> , there were more people in the room as here today , and in the middle <unk> i came out .
i had this forgotten .
i 've already memorized it 's coupons .
so again , the beginning , and at the same spot , i knew i do n't on .
this audience has more <unk> almost as i , because i went to settle down on my place , i brought my notes , put them , and i started the third time the beginning .
and they do n't think , how to me <unk> have for .
but that was a very existence .
perhaps that was also a the experiences , where i then i knew , with the piano , although i then quickly as a <unk> , i should probably did n't think there 's spent go , because at talk to be easier with cheating .
yes , the next the next chapter one of my adolescence , i said yes overridden by the inspiration and also because i want to tell stories .
when i then that <unk> was , i went to my <unk> and told him , rather than a gentleman <unk> , i 'd like a <unk> play .
and he said , oliver that 's not .
that 's kind of coffee houses and visit , and a lot of experience with women being made .
now suppose we time ago , a <unk> young man , so , young , such a sentence .
she says , so i do n't forget .
and from there to have i mean , even more of practicing .
now i was done by foundations and the time in a <unk> .
i 've been practicing and i remember in a situation that i think that was no longer have experienced .
it was that <unk> of dress up by chopin , and now i get to the part of work , i have a job simply no controls , and she was with the nicest place , very broad , you had the poor do , and then you see this together again , and back apart .
i can now unfortunately , not going to play , is not a piano , here , and i could be there 's no longer .
i have this point was , 30 times was playing and suddenly , you right .
and then i did it 's coupons and <unk> , i was in a feeling ecstasy and hit , and i 'm just that i suddenly on the ground booted out and laugh .
i was , except me .
i had nothing to drink , nothing in fact , and the music has this with me that .
one experience , where i 've learned , emotions , also really to occur .
and it 's also really , we have to work that you in this . it <unk> , in this condition , i call it , of <unk> .
where all of themselves involved .
we had this situation in fact , and then in the <unk> <unk> in an organization .
there was then almost anything like by itself , when we the <unk> made , has the only two and months for , where you usually a half years for would need .
so , that were my experiences with the piano , with the art , with the artistic quality work .
and now i get to my science , an age-grade system .
i was first , as a musician , which , but when <unk> .
we have <unk> performed , <unk> , <unk> .
i 've <unk> you , and i 've got me and so that next to my <unk> for the music to get people can and that <unk> had .
in the choir singing , together we breathe , a <unk> singing , amazing experiences that i 'm very , on sex life has .
and yet , a point , where i 've been a student in the <unk> theater , in the <unk> 've gone , in the <unk> and the overhead , and so i 've so with an age-grade overridden , this chapter , because there me this <unk> came , or that this idea came , from this combination of art , culture , i was then , <unk> also just in the <unk> place , politics and school , a little relevance to do .
because the art , nurture the place , to my <unk> to do .
so here to work for the art , but it 's not as artists , but otherwise , you would n't say <unk> , but rather than <unk> what and continues to be done .
so i was in the theater and i 've got me <unk> , there was in germany , a program for <unk> , just in vienna , there , i am i did , and from there , i 've always more with that question , concerned , what we can do , for art of the place , the framework for art to improve , to say a management , a good to manage to create that ?
and that was the reason , why i then you stop at 'm in my career , moving towards this <unk> , and with <unk> years ago , i mean , then <unk> .
but it was a different <unk> , and this phase , i said yes overridden by interaction .
<unk> i came to the germans <unk> .
the german <unk> has his <unk> in <unk> .
i 'm <unk> , though sometimes in my c.v , because i in <unk> born , and says , the <unk> oliver <unk> , about <unk> i , i have this kind of time <unk> .
but i 've given a <unk> root , because my maternal grandparents were also <unk> <unk> , and there , in <unk> , i have the carnivale teach .
this was to me to something that i do n't really enjoyed , and suddenly i became immersed in a different form of culture , in a <unk> , in a culture , who lived out of people in this in the bureaucratic device of <unk> .
once the carnivale on us coming , were all in a very different position , in a very different states .
and i 'm going to <unk> <unk> , the future <unk> and <unk> <unk> , of my friend and colleague , and then we have always required to <unk> christmas music done , he had guitar , i piano , yet another one 's being played , for example , i could then it <unk> .
we have the <unk> <unk> done , so , but of on the lyrics of <unk> <unk> , for months , being .
and this carnivale that was really from the people out .
it was my destiny , that i am , november <unk> for my <unk> learned and i <unk> n't start with that the wall fell .
i woke up the next day on , i was oral exam , oh , the wall is like , yes .
i 've got me more quickly it comes for , in any questions for <unk> .
and down , because i was a trustee of the cities in the east germany .
and i 've got to teach , as an interaction as casual interaction take place between two young german culture .
it 's talk the same language , the music is there as well , and was wonderful , performed , but lots of this was <unk> , <unk> .
different than the carnivale did n't it from the people all of myself , but it 's how much of the top , and that i have a great information was feeling , here to experience , like the german , as well , it brings me afterwards , even more time ago , starting to trajectory completely broken , and the german <unk> then these two states remembered and you have .
now is germany , yes <unk> .
now is also on the perks , much more <unk> , places .
interaction , i then , but of all things here learned and experienced , in the city of food .
we have the position of that i had actually a <unk> , so now , the time ago , when i 'm here , i started , <unk> , stood on my <unk> <unk> for culture and play .
i 've had another .
leisure technology for <unk> , you did n't write <unk> for culture and <unk> .
i was actually looking at the first of the ladder of <unk> .
so i have any leisure can not so much so , anyway , this wonderful that i said that <unk> , but they would soon , because i then on education in charge , and so alliances with the education , and make it could do .
we have a lot of the studies done , we have the if you only time that understanding metabolic rate of <unk> , <unk> and <unk> see , what we there isn’t , the <unk> experience , <unk> , where you interactions between the beginning , and architecture to experience , from <unk> to <unk> at the blue one of stones .
many , interactions , we could and i could actually designing and i 've experienced , and they noted , which means that if different people from different areas combined a target to catch .

interaction , and then in the <unk> the subject as we , <unk> , seven <unk> the idea of them , and when january <unk> that <unk> be able to the <unk> europa interacts it .
but that last chapter , this one fifth one chapter , but the rubric of identification .




and that 's a big thing that point .
five billion point three million people trying , to move , <unk> cities , to identify the double coupons and so , to <unk> and to realize that you a community is in europe .
as big , we then <unk> called , but anyway , as a community of many people that in a big <unk> life and yet , at a common language to talk , even if <unk> nations are here and this was our main purpose , the positive to initiate the people and of them , too much the ride .
at yield signs , at the <unk> the highway , many other moments .
an experience of the <unk> did n't have that many people noticed .
so ham 's <unk> <unk> and eat , two schools , given us , young girl from <unk> , of the <unk> , and young qatari students from a they speak at school , from <unk> <unk> , letters of people , young men , from <unk> to play together , the home , and say , love , death , the last letter writing , .
and it was a special effect that young girl next letter from young <unk> saying , and young russians and then sent letters from young men in germany in a broken german .
and there sits down to one of these young men , in the piano , and he played this <unk> , the i so loved .

and he <unk> his finger at an <unk> , set up to the piano in that play on <unk> carl , i tried to <unk> to play .
and it did n't show him .
it was for me as a touching the shot that i said to the front of the way to it , i 've said , what we actually have learned ?
we 've learned , in the <unk> that many people together to move anything , but of all things we 've learned that we <unk> years in the trogontherii in peace , and culture that links that 's no longer the minds go , because we different languages to talk that we 're going to identify ourselves as that 's like they feel .
and it was for me a wonderful experience and you see , it 's going to learn not just about , something to know .
it 's going to learn and therefore , something to learn and <unk> to win .
and we 're pretty much force reinventing and invention to happen , <unk> , if we tolerate that we spark off pieces of art and culture , our own right position to teach us , in a dialog with the artwork , if we interact and finally , in our own identity , again and work , if we talk about art and cultural history , then we all of
and i hope that they still a lot <unk> and <unk> , of which they those profit it .
thank you .
yes , thank you .
i think , we wait on the first picture , the things .
so i have to <unk> to support my <unk> here , such a few slides <unk> .
there are , but no scientific slides , but it 's in my <unk> here 's about , a way to find and me with a subject to , where i think that 's going to the next few years of roads a culture .
by the <unk> words , i know now finally , thank you something that ted 's also means , and i think , in <unk> we can this talk is quite arbitrary spectrum .
and then i 'd heard that you the papers in english is we should , if somehow able , but , if you look at it , then you see , you would n't understand , what i in english to say , i did n't know , right , as i tell them and so i have to talk , and then , but in german conversation .
how we will die .
i have them because the first of <unk> tell .
<unk> was a patient in the hospital , where i the <unk> <unk> , and i was the ground .
she was about those years old and has always like to may , yeah , because they also to her husband who reminded , the first man that in war like it was then .
and this is it every year for the first of may to dance were sanitation and has long , yeah , and probably even then a <unk> <unk> too much to drink , and then is ground and played out , here on the right-hand side you see this , the leg gets broken , the <unk> .
a few years previously , though it 's gone on ground and i had to the same way , with the same reasons for that 's gone on the left leg gets broken .
and i was also been there as a physician and i 've experienced , as you weeks on the intensive care , so , to antibiotics that was treated , also been re-inhabited , and i have the debate it , as i was , is because it makes sense ?
it makes any sense , in one such ancient people like this intense way of the effort to get ?
so speaking , to <unk> , on the intensive care for weeks , it 's a people ever <unk> ?
and it 's going to be healed and massacred .
five years later i get into the clinic , i see the name <unk> , and the can i got you notice , because he just so rare is , the time that time , and , the dance in the may , again , the other one leg gets broken .

and that 's a bit about this topic of the presentation .
and also then the <unk> of the machinery , how we will die .
it 's a book out of <unk> , how we 're working , a report on the <unk>
and then it was so , that globalization really come forward , that so you to ask , and how do it because , are governed , to work ?
you have then , and that you can in this book now as well , but , i said , it 's a quality control , so that the units getting together .
it 's a interconnectedness of labor in , it will also the job even a lot more you 're , for example , after china , this was a big issue .

and that , after my appreciation that people just less and confidence from their jobs may be able , and more and part of a little <unk> were , where it was designing , as height of <unk> to reach , and not worried about it , through his work to be able to define .
and if we now carry on the <unk> and medical field , then there 's obviously just as a trend .
if you 're watching television and even hear , what doctors , they want and <unk> the most of lawsuits , then it 's the so-called <unk> .
and this was nothing else , when there has documented , what you have done , so it <unk> is , so we would ever paid , and if not going to document is , and says the health service , you that care or the medical treatment for everybody 's not .
and through this feature documentary , but the work <unk> getting more <unk> and more and getting this idea that you his work is fulfilling and to use of personal belief compound , in the background , such a <unk> , <unk> , and <unk> .
a good friend of me , after the left , because he showed this is no longer , who had a <unk> practice , has the nurse , after the left , the doctor for <unk> to be .
the <unk> are on these trends , usually a piece of parliament and he , the martin , had just experienced that are more and old people who was commuting between the home , the hospital , , and back , because the <unk> do n't know , what they do that if it the people got worse , went .
and then , the the hospital , will have restored to go back to the senior home , or a nursing home , and be there on , powered .
and this a family had to just about , if it 's a teacher pay in holland , then i want to be like to train crash , about something here , advancing that you from this cascade of <unk> and of the <unk> <unk> of people <unk> can .
there , well , in the point had he depends what 's , after he the language to work as adults had learned that there , the same thing happens , what about this <unk> had happened .
it will also to die , a quality control their inception .
it 's no longer the credibility that counts , but you put even in an available to find , i want for example , not been re-inhabited , or not the hospital , as i look at home am .

in the it 's so , the third day or find a conversation with the admitted that instead , and they have come to establish that i want to the hospital or i want to the hospital , when i do something happens .
so just about , i want to form , or i want to do n't been going .

if we now to <unk> think that yes , like to may , yeah , and once a cliff , and we imagine that would operate at an advance directives , written , i would n't been re-inhabited , then you know , they do that would have the dance in may be going to may , where they then she fell , admittedly , no more experienced what can .
and this raises my friend now , the there in holland , too much <unk> , how he deal with that happen .
in the past it 's so that <unk> today about <unk> to 70 percent of people to come back home to die , but in hospitals , from rating , and that these institutions cause , you so you can perceive , not the ideals of habitat , for the old people , but it 's often the `` those tightly <unk> that that there , the <unk> are often <unk> and the funding in and of course , this <unk> it is where , after my sense , just limited , instead .
there are being that are planning that this very good way , there are very <unk> people that , there in fact , but if i the <unk> a region , and we have about <unk> patients in the year , so i was about five , six , who might hail from <unk> to us <unk> , then i would for me say , it is quite difficult , and to cope and be for the self-esteem , are .
this has , of <unk> reasons , that 's very clearly , this whole quality control , that control is therefore becoming , because the past the money for not enough , all people can use and in across scales are going and that the people that the care for good or the medical community services , so we 're paid , that they say , there was -- i 'm okay to realize that i can for example , when they had a family of feed with one or two children .
this is today just not the fact , but you need two salaries , in <unk> and <unk> and mostly comes down and then you just come .
this introduction of control , as a result of constantly up the marketplace , the way to regulate , etc. , , so it on the individual countries affected .
and now i 'll talk about this , how to the maybe we can escape , so what do we now in the past , because i 've been put them questions , and frustrating placement , so very simple 's the situation for affected by not .
and i 've just that <unk> <unk> and this paper very challenging me there <unk> , because i think , a society , and this structure , and legal structure , in which we all this <unk> , what happens in our society .
and in <unk> article in one is just that would of people 's <unk> .
and the second set up there is , you to protect is justice mission of <unk> .
and what i sometimes it 's missing , a third set in there is , because every one , also for a brief to have to be , their dignity of protecting and to defend islam .
because it a way , asking yourself to be free from this case , i 'll see this in other way , and they are me to somehow we mentor , and leather goods and then we need that i look at least not thinking about doing , like me because even die 'm going .
because the past this is , so , even if we do this subject does n't like to imagine , we 're somewhere along the point of coming .
hopefully not be late , with a century or <unk> .
the equivalent of my career as well , to say , that i hope for each and i want to be able to worry , but eventually you going to the subject would have , and if you might be so far , or even just , if you <unk> , <unk> or <unk> is , it already late in life to be late in life be , to say , i 'm talking about this question now once a no-brainer .
so if you think about , what does mean i 'd like , then you going on the dots , where in the last out , which is because essentially the five major things in my life has been ?
there 's now a book , what kind en <unk> is .
it 's the self-esteem of course , there are then the friends that i have , with that i go and exchange can that you know me and the me through the life record , it 's the <unk> .
it 's sure that trust between humans , with whom i may be able to do , in <unk> or ideally you like 50,000 or a pastor or a <unk> or just another person , with that i put in the relationship to put them .
and there are there 's many individual points of course , there <unk> , i 'm going to do n't all through .

and then arises then one another factor , and that 's a certain dictatorship suppressing the <unk> experience , i 've got this time , such as a text , or as as an example of this .
other people can for us these decisions and that behavior , which there <unk> , not meet .
this is my inner conviction .
we would you can only from ourselves come out .
so it 's not the question , which are because others to me to do , who gets me because time to power , a thing , or , for me in fact , who 's going to me ?
but it 's exactly the other way , to ask , where i can kind of people , where i can see me around and by my clock would get that i do anything to ask them , and me . there 's position and reframe that can .
and if you and says , how we 're working , so this is the inside the quality control , the us from the outside that had been , it 's a way , to say , i me about my my clock would , this mechanism to escape .
because no man can tell me <unk> , how i myself , because you see , and position to .
and i must be there 's also not fit in general <unk> or ideas , who say , you 've now an advance directives out and because you been so old , thou , ; you exactly , if you 've been re-inhabited , you want , if you on an icu . will .
these questions that i can be in the last only after a long <unk> what makes them .
this would of people 's a clock of that makes me , and not the outside it gives you can be that the bureau 's not can protect , as a law , not , and i also other people <unk> , and i 'm going to <unk> , when i just there myself before faced with myself have , so that you know what i was for a person , i am .
and for those conversations to lead , it needs just sealed spaces , and i think , and why i put this talk so called , and here in 30 years , are those spaces like this <unk> into food , that i have you here two things tried , on a picture times <unk> , let me , where we over these issues you need to think , where a <unk> space is , so that there 's not because it is that it may not being analyzed theoretically , but that just a conversation . there 's happening .
so we , if we then the old are , that i would say , well , such a dance in the may , despite my husband might be very much different ages , this would have to what .
thank you very much for your attention .
beautiful good evening .
i 'm bringing two things with .
if you the first part of flat , you should stay a little <unk>
it 's quite a second .
we start with infinite .
this is really dumb , not , can take .
what you mean ?
it 's different <unk> ?
it 's infinite enough ?
yes !
this is not good , if this one of it is , the what 's nice .
so , in fact , but i 'll it off , for the that you know it .
and that we do n't .
we employ us with just one .
and i crossed it sounded like a little sentence for a finite element .

and it 's for the <unk> of magnitude of vast amounts .
if we in a finite which are , and add two <unk> , in a for example , chairs , in the other people .
we know , so , now been , we look at the box in the thing that number is small , there are three : chairs and there are three people .
we can we sat scores , whether in each of the same amount of elements in it 's ?
they count , how would we 're doing it ?
that means we would just the people <unk> , one , two , three , let 's the three , we count the chairs , three : chairs , one , two , three , three and these three is three , and beautifully .
that you mean , yeah ?
very beautiful .
this works in a finite wonderful that work in large numbers , although it sucks .
but it matches .
what about it 's counting ?
what about a twitter that so many people like the chairs out there are ?
i 've got aware of the chairs and people in fact , and not something else .
<unk> let me !
it 's shoes .
you very well , that it 's obvious , not , now we 're on a way and even understand it all .
not that 's very nice .
so , it 's also turns out a <unk> and it works as well , yeah ?
you take a , put them on a chair , from the mouse .
the next <unk> , way , the next <unk> , everything is a little bit , different people get different musical chairs , not a chair , abandoned and the sets are the same size , okay ?
now let 's the infinity .
how we can two infinite sets that to compare biospheres ?
we would say , the one is that big or bigger or smaller than the other .
we could we 're doing it ?
we would go back to .
right , it 's wrong , because the point is the , if you in an infinite number one of starting to count , yes , i 'd just simply say , they are not to another .
square , infinitely , is clear , square ?
so , how is it ?
madame ?
we , madame !
they had this , but just really started .
they mate .
so , let 's what happens to .
we estimate , appreciate is the infinite always bad , yeah ?
you is what you is no end , yeah ?
the point is what , you do it very simple .
if i for example , the <unk> suppose , natural numbers , square , we computer scientist who need to zero in the beginning , zero , one , two , three , four , five .
and we have , if you got time , a copy of this <unk> and take off of paper , the infinite amount <unk> pay off .
be left the just numbers , okay , zero , two , four , six , eight , square ?
okay ?
all the straight numbers are <unk> on the end of a long line across the natural longitudinal data , but on a band n't have the <unk> , on the others are the line , and the <unk> it , okay ?
we call the a lot of the straight to pay , we call the other sorts of n , the natural longitudinal data .
what you think ?
is , g , more powerful , it 's bigger than through n , the same size or smaller ?
in a big ?
but this is very risky , and i 'm on a missing component is the <unk> .
who are an informed estimate that ?
right ?
who says , bigger ?
ah , who have really do n't plan , yeah ?
that we can also not be , yeah ?
you ca n't mean , where what 's missing , bigger , it does n't , square ?
okay , they go smaller ?
you 'd assume , not ?
this is normal , what you say , is , of false .
and now , and now i 'm explaining what 's the amount of the are .
and how does it ?
right .
yes , we mate .
this is the point .
we mate .
we take the zero from the line of , we take the zero from a lot , mate , out .
the next to zero , after , plus two , two , after the zero , one , and i 'll get back a <unk> .
the four , the two , the six , the three that eight , the four , yeah ?
you can make it funds , then becomes a 's doubling , it 's obvious , square ?
and it 's clear , through the <unk> 's make it that i do it always in the lecture that 's a <unk> <unk> .
and this one , there 's the line , it , and the tape is in a long , yeah ?
we <unk> the natural diet on the line , <unk> , the <unk> are out , and the tape is still in a long .
it 's only in the infinite .
so if you some of explaining , what if we have learned , infinity learned , yes , which is because no end , i know , just finally ?
an infinite amount of has a property that 's a finite right and this trait , which is , is absolute <unk> a true , subset of that just as big is .
that they make a finite not , if you look forward three people two people <unk> that 's just another one and we 've been doing , three .
yes , so we 've infinity .

okay .
then we make a second part , probability .
the professionals , of all likelihood .
i have this scares me .
with this experiment , i 'm sure , it at least one third , and <unk> it does anybody with , and it has , yeah ?
so , we call the doors and mobility , b , c .
i 've got onto something hidden , i hope that they do n't heard .
and they are now in the first peak .
where , you mean , i have something hidden , behind the a , b , or c ?
guess , here , our <unk> , here .
they number in c .
who has another idea ?
the a ?
who has got another idea ?

that 's right .
it 's a matter , so they have n't mean , the three of letters to fall and i 'm looking for me one .
it 's really matter , yeah ?
it is completely clear , because that the chance that they jesus , they 're lucky , is yes , jesus , about one-third .
square , there are three things , it 's really matter , yeah ?
now i am here , i 'm just one on .
well , i know , where it 's up .
<unk> , this is what anybody here , square .
so , i know , where there is , and the hunting and this is , or how do whatever you it 's called , goes into a second round .
so i 'm now actually the rules to paint and i 'm basically now only <unk> .
so it 's so , we go into a second round .
now , so , i <unk> me on this a , square ?
so , i have a door to show , behind the n't it 's and they do n't have said .
because , if you 're now e.b say , and i say , and i know , it 's not like a b .
then there would n't second round .
then i say , <unk> , from the mouse , if you do not him .
but i have , that 's 101 , in the second round and go .
so i can only one up , behind the it 's not only is , but what they do n't have said .
now is the question , and it 's sort of all likelihood , under the mind here on , under the sisyphic condition that point b is open , and it 's not there is , you have now your last chance , trying to guess .
they 're now at a to stay , then i do 's a , on .
i 'm now this on , what they want to have .
or they say , i 'm a c , on .
now is the <unk> , it 's now with this knowledge likely to become ?
phew , very beautiful , b is on , now i know , it 's a c .
right now , thank you know that , b is open up , i always wanted to a to stay , this is it .
or would you 're saying , but <unk> , we have , square , and so , we 've just two doors , now it 's no matter , to change , or to stay .
what you mean ?
it 's no matter .
<unk> .
why it 's no matter ?
very beautiful .
why it 's why is it <unk> ?
yes , yes , it 's wrong .
this seems like i can almost , as if we had a <unk> would , square ?
but that they are , square , are a new , no fun .
so , this , the thing is very <unk> , yes .
understand that all sorts between , i 'm not , six and , yes , i ca n't <unk> years , otherwise would i 'm going to come up , square ?
so , this issue that everybody .
after this door is it 's a third .
and it 's always just a third plant behind a door .
you can guess , what they want , they have with two thirds are you in the dirt .
that would you can go to two doors to guess what does n't that you ca : yes , at <unk> do , you can listen , on two dozen or anything , then it 's my , square , if you the ground zero to <unk> , it 's yes , everything in real life .
but here we 've just a door .
so , is this , two thirds of it 's not , what you guess .
so this is two-thirds here , but it can , but behind a door to lie !
behind the clitoris is a 's not !
so , which is then more likely ?
we , i really have it 's hidden .
so , which is now more likely ?
it 's better , to stay , or to change ?
now it 's easy , yeah ?
yes , of !
so , that was now not hard , square ?
ha !
what we see ?
they 've got unlucky . anyway .
why ?
very simple , as two thirds are not a hundred percent , the difference between the theory and practice .
i hope , it was to everybody how this .
thank you .
mr. <unk> that i want to be like jamie oliver <unk> , who are doing here of bad food and you know , food and obese people who says , this depressed as a computer is completely .
but i <unk> 's my best thing , that after all over the way , that some insights .
i 'll get tired , because of <unk> farm and i knew i went to 12 was not a mcdonald 's .
that ever known for , , right .
yeah .
thank you for the us today .
i 'm here in close up .
and i do n't know , whether you sir <unk> that as it came to me to ask , if i think about the ted , the seas as well , etc. , and over a particular topic want to talk .
i 've got me <unk> <unk> : the subject matter .
now , motivations of it 's not bad and i <unk> me the woman <unk> at that has said , maybe it makes the one or else has become more like sports .
about how i 've got to have .
so tonight about the rain more and so to go to be now <unk> a tall , but i have this morning in fact , training , because i in three weeks ago at <unk> june , to <unk> , of <unk> to oslo , they 're just want to 'm a bicycle company -- that are <unk> miles .
in me , morning when rains this training do n't get freed up .

i 've got tired , already said , briefly , i <unk> ' <unk> the issue of trust .
and i 've ever since i started , the light , with the subject <unk> .
n't worry , the nice , little <unk> , the blind faith is going <unk> .
i 've ever seen before me just thinking about it made , when i <unk> , how to me on top where i <unk> ?
so , i come from 'm half the village with six ] houses , thank <unk> , some <unk> and in my parents , on the courtyard , it 's apple apples , <unk> and <unk> -- and what do you look <unk> , beer .
trust , in sports , of course not in <unk> but at me , <unk> and beer .
why give him . '' i the story , from where i mean ?
for me is one of the very important stories that i really that right from the country , the village get tired and there was raised around with two big brothers , with the oldest one brother , the <unk> is .
and with the other baby brother , the same way we 're blind is like me .
i mean , who looks like bright and dark , who can i do you see , where <unk> window in space , whether it on lights , or out .
what today 's very convenient is for the police knocked another .
the , or we both can you see , if of us something .
'n street , but i say , and i ca n't tell , is <unk> man <unk> goalposts .
of the subject of the old men , square .
and again until this way into .
and what to me and it was critical , is , of it 's the fact , as responsible for you trust and you 'll just this great confidence that <unk> that we all need , <unk> as something <unk> situation , well , i time .
and that was for my parents definitely know that you how many of them , outside my brother and i still not even blind people knew .
we were so the first , and then sort of in their lives <unk> are .
and then they had scavenged from the situation of what do .
and , now i love me , it 's a lucky that my parents than 185 farmers are not the all day , beside us to giving us to the hand to lead , or to say , there 's square wall , there <unk> you just along and you can , then <unk> feel , where you <unk> .
a , that would be awkward been -- we 've got home so <unk> .
and b , ham , our parents to begin with us to be empowered , every time to go , where you know what we 're sighted brother is .
so , in the home alone <unk> , the stairs , up and <unk> , it also a chance .
there 's the blind brother , i 'm going to 'm <unk> <unk> the full impact <unk> of pure .
the shape the shape , i have to another .
so it is with the big brothers -- who are not only good for the elbow , but also for the <unk> .
and our brother and and my brothers and i we ham in 'm a courtyard , the things that all i 'd done , what ma , you could do , of all for example , bike ride .
and that 's the who are brother , with that we are starting with three years , and then we were obviously also -- michael and i .
and , then started , with <unk> to drive , how to a little kids , today to get is that <unk> <unk> <unk> .
until the <unk> that can .
but we have that 's starting with <unk> , sometime during this .
and then is the big question : how about the yo-yo ma , there ?
and how do you that trust , one that trust the parents that the children and eventually spawned again from the bicycle <unk> and <unk> and on the trust of us that we 're not permanently , where to drive .
and our solution was that we of a , of our parents tell us have , where are the <unk> , so where there is a car , where <unk> followers , what might also have any unfamiliar that stuff , their homes -- which is now you can not the way -- there , we knew that they are .
and we had in between themselves , us that one hand , remember , but the other i also hear .
and that you can now in here i 'm not all the test , because otherwise , it here so noisy , that it 's nothing more of that was .
but <unk> ever seen tonight , if you let 's the lights off and , in their bedrooms , or in and whose bedroom , and then they orient to .
you can even try , just <unk> associate with the tongue , so , to orient and they 're going to find that 's happening for us humans as in the bats as well -- they 're a resistance to hear .
so how the bats that with <unk> 're also you hear , now <unk> wall , <unk> resistance , because the sound of different <unk> will .
and this is for me in trust , so trust and in the movement , getting very important point .
but <unk> of stays high a backup to have and the safety , i 've ever seen square chance , was <unk> piece to help .
and i 'm describing to reorientate themselves without a big trouble and now , you also having many accidents , the one or other , store-bought of it .
i 'm going to do n't paintings anymore , `` well , that i really <unk> itself is , one of our <unk> as children .
because the mountain climbing onto our higher building on ♫ i 'm a courtyard .
i 've ever seen here 's written , the confidence , also emerging from a <unk> diversity .
and that my goodness ' i 've been very literally , because i 've been a man , who are much too late in <unk> and in the <unk> to rely on the science data site has got tired , i 'm talking about one thing i never listen , or i 've never this ecology as i 'm doing themselves have experienced .
i got tired of never been so you may also become significantly to read .
but it 's probably also to do with that it 's clearly not everybody that the question experimentally , what can .
variety is in discover the our strengths with the most important , and eventually to know , where i 'm pretty well , what i was a talent and where can i mean , really too full <unk> ?
and our brother -- again , who did michael and me still picking up on the roofs off the house .
so , then , okay , we ham and a <unk> .
there is from somewhere i 'm a window <unk> of the <unk> for example .
and the earring actually went and then right away , michael afterwards , and i was like , probably already in <unk> little bit like this girl playing , square square , i 'm not .
but after all , who are like the bottom ?
so i do n't .

and of why am i know , then i still with .
and then was taken the consequence that we operate at all three <unk> <unk> up sitting and the dad with 'm half of them with 'm <unk> walked up and do n't even more i knew , what he now supposed to say .
because of this is sort of course , then the way , if other internet .
i had the father so , to my god , aid , aid , aid , then about vermeer 's the risk of the relative size by that one of us also fear and abbott to have , and in <unk> <unk> , <unk> , <unk> -- i 'm not -- somehow <unk> would be .
is nothin ' but never happens .
he had to come and so <unk> that it 's just might be getting <unk> , or an earring having said , who 's going to have .
and that , ' i for me a great that we these options we had .
but now , you do n't worry that 's not a principal , not that , after year later <unk> to do .
for me were the different can play that in my life and more importantly , all , yes , interesting .
and most of all they were all of this <unk> , because i 'll also see it could , where i said , ' i so i 'm sportin ' borders , which is maybe that my endowments .
so to <unk> good <unk> i would never be able to .
that i had never the <unk> .
and i do 'official ' to do n't like in <unk> .
i do 'official ' to get out into the rain .
now also not to five degrees of the moment .
and at <unk> rain -- but rather than models .
but i 've ever going to me so that trust in my strengths with that i different can play tried to have .
as the first for example <unk> .
and it was for me very good , because there 's the instructor that the us in <unk> , has said , ok , we have to these are kids , but they send it 's us <unk> couple of the blind children .
it 's actually yes , because there are able to belong to each of coats .
and then makes you , what the other people power .
and there was always been so my big trust , of course , when i could be competition for the place it 's a 's hard , because then , the other perhaps , but what do , what i do n't <unk> .
so it 's not just a way , and this is implicit faith in the speed .
the other to grab a foot in the top of my wishes , i 've gone backwards fall , the <unk> head . '' and then it 's sitting in the back and the competition is over , because it 's the full score is .
i 'm going to do n't try out .
i had i 'm asking about , but square .
i believe that 's binary code that 's now <unk> some risks .
and i would be here 's not a volunteer , right ?
square .
oops , i <unk> 's already .
okay .
the next to me point was a sports , in school but then the <unk> and just <unk> .
my parents were home or are , to <unk> and that you have to be taught me as children .
but to me was always in school to be important : how can i as much as well , after the school to move to my excess energy getting rid of ?
and i had then a way in school <unk> to do .
and although i actually always thought , that 's all that 's <unk> boring , because <unk> is sort of the <unk> more , love ' i .
i found ' i used -- love ' i 'm not anymore .
i was then eventually said : well , i do with the <unk> .

<unk> -- you may have a lot also from their work in the society ?
that is it in <unk> .
you will only then quickly , if you just the full of trust in the fact , with technology has .
if you that trust in your own mark of has -- so the force that you that you then at any circumstances , the bad weather , the soft power of snow , in <unk> snow and also on the mid-atlantic can associate .
and if you in my case you trust in the team has .
because when <unk> that does n't see , so i 'm trained <unk> <unk> .
and i realized that 's never have that <unk> happens like today -- i have the word to use -- my <unk> -- because we 're not only one -- has already today even my exercise .
well , but nothing , we do you yet again .
and more i <unk> do you might just divided .
do with a , one , one of fame after another task .
what i think is always make the subject and what we trust , this is the practice , that i do the listener to just imagine , i 'll see how it 's so , when you do n't see this <unk> to make and with their 40s <unk> <unk> .
in <unk> <unk> yes , so , you have two sticks in his hand .
it 's why : yeah , i said , ' i do n't get more open , otherwise would i mean , my goodness ' <unk> take and for the <unk> below .
n't do .
so i have to me different helping .
so i then my <unk> and , the before i am running .
and the accounts for me with the voice , the way .
so who has just always wanting precise <unk> do .
and that 's important for trust .
the precision on the communications , so in the <unk> .
and the <unk> tells me just always <unk> , if it <unk> goes , who tells me <unk> and <unk> , who says then , left at 11 , then i know it 's easy to left , so the upper part of the clock , with the pointer .
when he says , left to 10 little sharper to left , and when he says , right on top 10 .
okay , all understand ?
then <unk> <unk> problem , because then i have to do <unk> or they want to me back to correct , then i learned in any case , here 's what do n't .
and for me is that very large , critical , if the <unk> before i am running , then i have the really completely <unk> about violent times as opposed to say .
for a 's inherently beneficial to say , he 's for me that tool that it enables me , just really , and then quickly to be , and in <unk> even faster than others , who are on follow-up competition to start .
and that i can only , when i do you do one , with both arms me <unk> , i <unk> , on a leg anchored to stand and i have now actually the eyes to make -- ha ha -- or she can also open , which brings is nothing .
and must then this <unk> and must then on the other one leg and likewise , again , and we 're here <unk> of balance , but has actually sort of quiet and stand .
also with high shoes .
yeah , and this is for me that very important , when i think about the <unk> 'm just imagine : how <unk> i 'm doing , the guy to say , so i say a guy , because i actually just men as <unk> , now , how the just to say , hey , you 've crossed the right <unk> do , because of course , who is ourselves .
the white is not so , what he tell me to .
so i 've been such that kills him the way to just showed up to .
and that 's like in a process .
if anyone in my needs n't know , he told me , of n't help , but there i am just wondered , and have to say : well , i need that 's about you the curve , maybe <unk> <unk> in with threatened .
or i need that 's about you like now as riding that you just showed me also to say , how long , the mountain , is , because if we the <unk> <unk> , because i think we ever found : now , it has given to be .
and it appears again in , like nuts and this thing does not on .
and practice . '' this : so i 've also have a pilot , how it , biking is , on ♫ i 'm <unk> forward , the me and says we , unfortunately only 20 minutes left behind us , because we may -- so we ham the other times <unk> minutes of being used -- then is it may yet again , to be <unk> .
it 's why is that for me as important , there 's also the exact name , weirdly fine-tuned <unk> to have .
i listen , ' <unk> -- here 's probably another , and also <unk> <unk> driving ?
who provides more ?

and to forecast the moment very <unk> .
and for me , as i said , are these fine <unk> only then as possible , when i mean your ears , frankly , in .
the other me , you exactly explain , what he to see , and me so the possibility is , my risk in perfect , estimate .
and this is for me a the very important things , why i 'm saying , trust is more of training and not this banana <unk> .
so you know , ' sake of as a blind , not as much , be honest -- from <unk> .
because i also been the experience , to me a <unk> right , and the wrong and threatened had .
and then it was in the competition used to be bad , because it was the way across three meters <unk> .
and i 'm the three feet just <unk> .
of so -- as i said , this was -- of <unk> inadvertently .
that i 'm also , because the <unk> have to feel like i can turn around , have so <unk> <unk> .
and i happened there today , permanent ; that i people say , left and say , then , square , the other left .
so , then , right , unfortunately .
power in life often not as much like .
but now , in <unk> situation with pressure , that they will be all of the work or the campus like , and if it just quickly going to .
and then it 's kind of course , precision , often , yes <unk> <unk> hard challenge .
but to me , as i said , is what we trust me just one of that i the risk takers who have .
and i must be honest , say , i am when someone who does n't see , relative size of the upper hand , because i <unk> 's my risk in many ways .
so when <unk> <unk> ' i now this kind of all .
the driving <unk> tree , from falling into the slope , down <unk> that you know , and i and i <unk> ' but of -- and this is the key part -- i <unk> 's also the good news sites .
the fact , then also be done , if that trust this is there .
and if you know somebody has found that you really want a hundred percent of so <unk> , as i do you need .
and with the i of also liked the goals did .
because this is for me in the subject matter of the next , very important point .
you need to target and i have just really be , what does it because actually , trust the reckless risks ?
because of this is often <unk> faster the term , the you have used .
i trust at the or the right now i have gone .
but it 's yes , that it too much depend on .
that you for you for a lot <unk> .
and that we also -- because we are all with <unk> <unk> <unk> meeting -- we want <unk> that sense to see .
and the sense , who is quite often that we do you do , 'n end up to do .
that we do it -- in my case for example -- a couple of my , weeks , ' i am i on the <unk> gone .
and <unk> ' i just , i have so i would anybody looking , the or the i said in the case that trust , that i 'm describing this mountain in the point .
and how do you of these and that you on the mountain , and eventually , actually standing up ?
well , yeah , i had of the giants to harness , i 've ever seen some things do n't figure , if it for example , beside me a hundred meters <unk> .
then i was the relative , less .
ca <unk> to your advantage that 's fear is no problem .
and i was like , and again to the fear girls , regardless of the <unk> i 've gone off and to have a song just like , i then that made <unk> <unk> or i 'm in berlin <unk> flew too , because you going to <unk> <unk> <unk> of <unk> <unk> .
that 's some <unk> little <unk> , if you come up there is , and down the car stop , then you have n't even though we see , there to know , does now it hurts , when i <unk> .
and these things are for me , always been quite interesting .
now , you to be the <unk> to have , but by simply be able to know , hey , i war . ' heels of , i and so yeah , focus , <unk> and can just so , but also <unk> new new experience we have .
and that <unk> <unk> of the <unk> , because at <unk> mountain <unk> yes , so , you go every day , 10 hours to go down and it 's actually just a barren .
you go and go and only has just threw stones out for guys , less and plants .
you take the <unk> <unk> with , <unk> gun of before i 'm half the first world war in senegal .
so if you <unk> bison , it 's <unk> about the last , the <unk> .
of about this the only an exciting .
we have the killing of the distance , or the other things .
of so <unk> ' i there <unk> great confidence in the <unk> -- despite his strange <unk> that he did it had .
because i thought , '' : well , so , as i said , because <unk> ' i probably do that way , how to the this thing to be comical .
but as i said , it 's otherwise very <unk> , because you know about <unk> actually now not as a lot of transformation has .
and really exciting is that 's and then , as well , something hard it will .
so if you then in the height that comes up and the air thinner is .
or if it was a well , if you then <unk> littler dinosaur looked , where we left , right well .
and it 's a 's particularly beautiful and if we then also one night , and all with <unk> <unk> , then , with the <unk> been even sometimes , now , he would like me to the rope so , so he then i was also really a full-frame view , and in the grip , .
because i as the only without <unk> there <unk> and that was him and then , but sometimes to risks .
and we have it meant that i just said , am : well , i can of my <unk> , my friend and that it was , a hundred percent of trust , i <unk> ' she and we have that before , <unk> .
but i need that 's also square some sort of security , so i 'm not permanently in the focus has , because , you can imagine , if you on the mountain , always say <unk> stone , right , right on one , left at 11 .
there will eventually you <unk> , and everybody is .
so it 's implicit faith in the case , historically , we 're looking <unk> connection , so ham 's a wire on your backpack attached that i had in his hand , then left behind her to be used <unk> rope and forth .
i had in the other <unk> <unk> that i also with <unk> of the height of stairs i 've got tired .
and it is and then eventually the only still stuck with the foot <unk> stone is being or has with their <unk> <unk> rock on that i do you already knew , which is so on me coming and i 'm not permanently , you focus had .
and what i it matter how this really showed , how beautiful it 's actually , if you . of course , then eventually , because the top is that you just that goal really that back into it close to have -- just like we also the <unk> , with the gold medals .
and it 's but also that i 've got tired , that trust that i said to me , ' that is that 's 10 , just because , when i now actually <unk> goal was like , like this is the top .
but that trust is in other there , the <unk> , like trust and just work .
when we looked at night -- the mountain <unk> are , we were in the group is often very ahead and behind us are the other seven people and forth and they were always had dense behind us and it has to every moment was somebody else behind us and i 've been thinking : tell ' time , why do that because why , looking for whatever anybody that he 's behind us can run ?
at night , you can also the girls not from the back at .
this is somehow not the reason , apparently .
and then , ' i noticed , oh yeah , ok , yeah , their faith in their skills that 's degree , even at some pretty <unk> .
so you know that night by the darkness , you 'll be about 12 years at the matter , then the first , no light .
this is totally come up , if you <unk> is , the air is being thin , so actually just come up and now , no longer <unk> to put them .
and then , but eventually , so the moment , where they may have said yes , gee , that was really dedicated to basically , behind you to go , because the friend of mine has just showed me all explained , we 've constantly <unk> -- like that women to go .
have all the night of us anything about , and the other in the group had just because you so these discomforts , <unk> to know , ok , it 's just <unk> hour , that 's got me then told .
or i quit her what 's very different now , did not from the mountain , telling .
and that to know , it 's another person there , where it may also just bad go <unk> that we may have been talking about -- they 're just another square hour , the sun goes up on .
these same things that the glint of the outside can trust , again , who have to increase and can you , and helping that you so the personal medal but also done .
and to me is the best part of then you , and it 's best part of e : perfect , if you , so the personal medal and that are just really do n't want , then eventually , even on the idea of the right there is .
this is , of course , in the robot with the gold , in that you so <unk> -- you know , i actually also not why that the athletes do -- maybe , i 'm not to get around the value to test , or to look , whether to tase me just to lead , very is ?

if it 's very real gold would , then <unk> i 'm not here , then i 'd be on the bahamas , i made me .

but as i said , i believe that 's the real , why you do that , is more that you can imagine : what i got tired , i actually , created and how did i mean , skills and forces are focused on a point .
how did ' i went to me to my skills , but of the team that we all need , however , whether in college , in the job in which one thing also known forever .
anyway , whether an old man or young woman , we need for people , even in the we ca n't trust .
and if we then that goal in the head clear before you have eyes and also have achieved , that 's the best of evidence that we at least in a project in our lives at the way .
and if you know , again , you can do you definitely upward into the other fields .
thank you
a science for me , this is the title of my talk , the , is to <unk> of the maps .
what i tick , is the whole <unk> juice , the sciences , again as something <unk> in general population to attach .
what the fact , i was pleased to be .
if i in a noble , <unk> , it 's all <unk> only with the literature to the themes that <unk> <unk> is .
and everybody <unk> has a range of <unk> <unk> newspapers , magazines , <unk> , where science of topics , highly complex things , somehow understandable that would be .
every station has at a <unk> , where of science -- including the processes are .
and that 's totally <unk> , if you look like , what it in magazines and <unk> for children are familiar with the issues .
every program has sort of a flair for a in <unk> , but nevertheless , is this one of basic <unk> story .
science is one thing that can i like to see that can i love to read , but that occurs as i 'm not like myself .
cool , cool is science just a way to work on csi , in breaking bad , somewhere , there are the chemist cool , square ?
on csi , such a <unk> five minutes , has nothing at the reality to do , but it 's cool , square ?
there , there can i do .
big bang theory , because i can get into laughter , i understand the jokes , not , but it 's fine .
this is particularly bad .
because that 's kind of a little bit counterintuitive , the future , we 're just going to do with these sorts of issues and themes .
but at bay area that none of itself off .
i 've got a few little taste of a native americans , like science , or science at that one of them .
a very <unk> , in london , you have a nice little tower being built , <unk> , the architect , let 's not so now , we build the time somehow , so this curved .
what happens is , right now that the sunlight from top of the facade , finally , i 've got this time the rest of spontaneous , you 're doing and somewhere in other block at some point together .
this was the size by the press , stood there , unfortunately , on the jaguar .
so sad , the heat , so <unk> that this poor <unk> , the really long , long it saved enough , there are the <unk> ' time .
so you , such an architect , has n't actually sort of times as a little thing in physics had learned , because i mean , which is completely new , that such a glass office for doing .
so , what i 've found , really new , is <unk> , of two centuries before christ , where he 's supposed to ultraviolet a fleet of beds , .
there 's what i really , which has more of the design or an architect , or where he studied ?
now that 's a very <unk> example .
the classics , what kind of such as we see things , is also the genetic engineering .
genetic engineering , now that 's been a few years ago , as well , coming in the media was .
there was the train a little bit freaky , because <unk> changed the plants , that was to a danger .
genes , believing in green genetic engineering .

square , oh , there are gene inside .
there were moments , where in the market , really become like , hey , i 've <unk> vegetables .
no idea what that should be , yes .
so , yes , okay , english and tomatoes , we can get into discussing .
but the time i was in the lab , more active to come and was eventually you this frustrated , because i 've tried , these evil genes in my bacterial <unk> , these <unk> <unk> .
and was totally frustrated , came back home , and i was my neighbor , <unk> , you see , but not look happy , which is because this ?
i think this : yeah , i 'm there for three days , such a little gene in my bacteria to transform and this works at all .
this was , what i 've tried , to to explain , so somehow a <unk> , genetics , i thought , yes , ranging from the good old lady , when i think about genes , i speak , you know they already , what she says .
this was , what i 'm supposed to mean , so one particular sequence that i think there in this <unk> <unk> going to .
but this is that are the woman 's a pedophile .
this woman , i 'm never again , the hand , all shook up !
you know , what i do you <unk> , square ?

now that 's been good for 10 years ago , and yet , the way in consciousness is grounded .

<unk> i have very long to read .
it 's then the gene that kind of and it , but really in our language she kept .
<unk> want to europe , was a headline .
<unk> is really benefitted from relying on corn , the news is actually not genes which contained .
another news , <unk> to use rats to die .
yeah , it was also a beautiful headline .
they 're not that old and it 's also had no matter , in which set me to be ways .
anyway , whether the time or the picture , all talk about <unk> .
to happiness is it 's not <unk> in <unk> arrived , but i 'm sure that takes too , no longer length .
but that simply shows that uncertainty , in the population is now , because they do n't fit with the subjects to .
nevertheless , we need in our future us with these technologies are .
now i was just <unk> , nobody had the big on the subject , but it will fight about all flashing and you 're elected , what the most really no idea has .
and it 's pretty sad .
how is actually , this information from the lab in the population ?
if we assume , this small , boy , `` this scientist , sitting in his lab , has an experiment , we explore anything , beautiful and well , and he does is going to , gee , it 's what that interested in the public .
then you have the first of the professor go .
the head , the forward and then , okay , very cool topic , puts his name on it as an author , that 's always important in the science , author .
good idea , i 'm not now in the public , it 's got to a <unk> .
yes , the <unk> think , oh great idea , class , there 's make an issue into it .
<unk> , because we have an issue with a project , a nice idea , and this is that way out of ivory towers .
this is then <unk> , yes , but at who really ?
now are those heart institute hardly blame ourselves , usually have multiple <unk> such a common substrate , a common <unk> .
and of all these are then the <unk> that really cool , the projects , you 're going on the <unk> at the magazine described , at the <unk> , no matter whether it took leibniz , <unk> , <unk> or <unk> are .
this is the way .
of the ground , it will always on a matter , in come up until the really , west coast of experiments , then that actually speak of projects , there in these <unk> come up .
that are able to give high level magazine , who are actually done well , are some of all these are free , yes , and point that i do ?
what the fact that all that , for interest .
in the <unk> we call it always the <unk> the <unk> .
so that to have been able to be interested , who feeds these and yet the newspaper , yes , beautiful and good .
some magazine , reached the audience , and that are going to be interested , and maybe about an idea , where <unk> it 's even in these articles calculate .
who <unk> ' i so , but really ?
the <unk> that it to stay interested .
the , we , that was now , the letters citizen , i call the time , mr. <unk> <unk> , the under conditions of the publications i read , i 've tried , it , unbiased , to think , the point that i do n't really .
yet , again , our future , we 're just sort of mastery , if we do with these <unk> culture .
fracking , and genetic , renewables , <unk> , that 's all stories , the <unk> are , the gentleman <unk> but not really understand , and over and he sort of going to .
my project , my idea is so , unlike a piece , this simple , young , kinds of scientists out of come to take , really completely different from his regular <unk> them , and he goes in a to give , a seminar , how to science is intelligible to communicate .
what is usually happens that 's a scientist , so i have a buddy , we know of us as well , and twenty years ago , he 's <unk> , it 's happening for us a unwritten rule , it not to his job to ask .

square , that are scientists that tell you do is a kind of <unk> .
<unk> , , it sounds <unk> , square , <unk> is already nearly as the same level like the genes .
<unk> treated , this is somehow , oh , you do n't know , which are .
the really teach , pass a brief rundown on , that 's beautiful and well , if you live on a conference is , and having your people , for professionals , on <unk> anything to tell you want , then you like of <unk> tell , but they 're haunted by using a time , well , but just some water .
where is the problem , it really <unk> and normal to talk ?
i school , this is my idea , these young scientists that 's not so far in the hierarchy <unk> is that a little can see , the school , i like what paperwork intelligible to throw away .
it exists for every one , <unk> , as well , whatever , and investors , who want you know , which there in the <unk> happens .
eventually it 's also , tax , the there are used , so the need to actually also the at communication .
but the these training , this is just a story .
i want you also really a jury her sit and they are you project ourselves , you project a jury , you betcha , who does , frankly , there 's not , children .
there 's a quote , i do n't know that 's real , of albert einstein , if you do it 's not just tell you can , you 've got it does n't really understood .
so , the scientists from the lab to take and you project really to rethink , how can i do this is normal intelligible to communicate ?
so the stories are already several abandoned .
<unk> are totally modern , is everywhere , in on every college , custom , but also see in the point that i actually just over the <unk> .
who 's because for <unk> end of the city in the university at some morning , holt plays out there a talk to <unk> day off ?
this is the that it to stay interested .
i 've got to my <unk> .
so , are the people that to stay for interest , the cop to go and , there is to hear sound .
that 's beautiful , there are any <unk> done , all these are satisfied , all you 're happy , biking back and that 's it .
so i 'm still on a second thing , to say , there is not the <unk> the project .
those scientists are also a trained , like a ticking , actually children ?
because many really unlearned it , to the key to reduce .
because scientists , like the research , and how children of the world to explore , is the same .
so to work very extreme to scientifically .
they do anything that learning the pigeon .
they try to what , this work ?
<unk> , falling down , we , does n't work , next iteration , i change a couple of fitting , i do it a new .
children learn an extremely scientifically .
so there 's <unk> , <unk> and <unk> , i <unk> , what happens , which factors i will have that it works or not .
this is normal .
but that have a lot unlearned it .
and of so i think , really can work that only if , after the <unk> , and those scientists are enduring legacy of the neighborhood , in the environment with the kids out of kindergarten , from the elementary school , there in life experiments are the children , on their <unk> , and , there really focused on it 's going , because i 'm saying that children and the scientists are actually in is essentially a common language to talk .
and then you can perhaps , maybe someday , that 's my hope , tell the kids that then you can come back home , and then the point that i also a gentleman <unk> , the , then also to me for scientific data subjects were interested , because the children beside him that tell .
so this is not anywhere in the newspaper , that 's not anywhere in galileo , but his children to tell him a thing that it <unk> mirrors come from a <unk> worked that what this is a good-tasting bread <unk> , that there are paper <unk> , and understand until then also , and shaking , then perhaps even the head , as an architect , such a house can build .
and not just point that i then , of mr. <unk> , but also the <unk> .
this is my idea , my vision , my project .
unfortunately <unk> it just did that the first <unk> that i call , i have said , yes , we , so , <unk> for our scientists , that this is just not subject , they 're living in other priorities .
a scientist has n't mean you can communicate .
yes , i think i then , okay , then , and i the next to .
but who somehow in a department at work , <unk> is in a company , as well , whatever , there 's the next moment .
thank you .
i 'm crazy , is the question .
and i do you can also not every day .
the past weeks ago were terrible .
the weather us has a great assembly line through the calculation .
of seven , soon after eight years , i 'm focusing so , i be here it confers want .
i was before the ceo , almost 10 years , at the <unk> <unk> in munich , and in <unk> .
we 're there 's fairly common thinking about up to be .
they had <unk> as a client .
and for me it was actually more , it 's <unk> .
what is it really ?
<unk> , that 's going to this ridiculous .
so i then , but i 've learned that there 's so , i stand here today .
and yes , maybe it 's a little crazy , but it 's in any case , too high , emotionally .
it 's beautiful and always exciting and makes great fun .

i 'm from ceos in <unk> .
they are there for a century , and <unk> years .
i 'm the ceo of the <unk> .
this company , there 's for 20 years .
and managing the <unk> .
the company , there 's been approximately a collaborative hit eighteen years .
who runs the zeppelin and the <unk> .
zeppelin .
that a picture that i introduce this and i want to show , the little thing right , this is actually , such a red , such a <unk> it , or anything , do n't know , yes , because of that point is still too big .
there 's because the world 's just <unk> <unk> .
and it 's actually just now , 10 to action .
this is going to know what .
there 's about 20 thousand being a global <unk> .
so that is actually , no market .
it 's not just a niche drugs .
this is a <unk> , a <unk> .
and the question is also , why do you do that then i really ?
how does it anyway ?
<unk> in which consisted , and only 10 to action , because we can become more time talking about why this is .
so very quickly the history .
<unk> has a lot of crazy <unk> <unk> the aerospace and started sybase .
very short demolition of .
has to <unk> 14 to the first world war about eighteen <unk> the life , b .

they are in london , it bombed , and so forth and so on .

so that 's the story in there <unk> .
and we had an insane campaign .
but <unk> , the client , was n't really quite pleased , because it suddenly realized that 's become , which there 's behind it was that old memory in there 'd put them .
and you know that was taken for the marketing is a little critically .
but it was in london a great campaign for the weather in north end up there was so long ago , very bad and very windy .
and we 're not very much flew .
then , <unk> 20 , <unk> 21 , hugo <unk> this has paid .

it 's a myth that sounded very , that all the german nation of course , again something felt , as well actually <unk> and <unk> this was flying airship on hold hostage , .
there was the then in in new york was welcomed with tape parade .
and all the german nation 's got out , <unk> , we are again , who .
this is at all of lives , so in fact this is that tells a little movies a myth of this device .
but they 're going to <unk> and <unk> just five , six , seven voted for zeppelins even more there were built and actually just two really big , the <unk> zeppelin and it was going , the passengers do have .
passengers , a hundred , where about <unk> passengers , and <unk> it was the end <unk> <unk> .
it was , but a myth .
and the <unk> then was the first exploration live , these are the crash with there 's also , unfortunately , yes <unk> .

and the other boxes being biased .
and <unk> , <unk> the last one thing for zeppelins . most .
that the materials that uses for <unk> , <unk> , the halls come velocity .
and then i was a long nothing about <unk> years .
and then they had the <unk> zf <unk> and the zeppelin that had the idea , maybe you should it back to start .
and i was discontinued <unk> , because it 's technically a great product has evolved , we get the same thing , but the market .
yes , he 's actually a market ?
what is there really matter ?
so .
talk about that we now .
the <unk> zeppelin , that may be a moment to explain , we ham , in time it 's still , square , people have a lot of myself .
there are many companies that , for that <unk> now we are .
there are today <unk> staff , about 20 billion of revenue .
it 's a real economy , high as profitable .
there 's a lot behind .
and i was then also believe , here to come .
the zeppelin based on , is actually a normal plane as each other infinite plane as well , but , sorry , very a gas , why helium 's not evolve hydrogen , and very also a <unk> with <unk> .
is like a whale , the in the water on and below there , and the <unk> to alert .
the time it 's not there , that in the details to explain .
fundamentally does a zeppelin and so , with a structure .
there are two varieties of <unk> .
there 's form <unk> , that 's us , <unk> in the case , and <unk> .
they have drawn no structure and they are basically like a couple of <unk> .
this is the most <unk> , in the world was built , 24/7 , half a piece .
and it , you only today , as i said , you’re just <unk> in which consisted of minus to our own right , so that 's there 's been walking .
this is then the production , if a skin into protected them .
the left the structure , again .
and the shell is too high technology .
comes from <unk> .
source : the <unk> the astronauts .
<unk> then there are the roots .
it 's one point two million dollars , this sort of velum .
and is to <unk> be , to <unk> be , and also have <unk> be , because again and you have been inside that if a limb shot in which is , or a hole that it 's nothing to suck can .
there are doing the <unk> again <unk> , and look closely , whether it 's going on the holes in control .
and the end looks a controlled airship on without the south like it 's there .
the zeppelin -- is so technically a <unk> product
and that you see here at the numbers , very short time .
one point where nine percent , one point where nine percent , one point plus four percent <unk> , that is a thousand a thousand individual coming back in the last fall , maybe <unk> out .
this is very little bit , and very good .
this is a <unk> .
that is a divorce .
but there 's a lot of the trend that 's look at it does and the 've got up here 's mapped .

and this year in may we were at <unk> percent .
if you the eight years , eight years , at the zeppelin <unk> and <unk> from this way , etc. , then you can say at least in these eight years , of the blink of the <unk> , also clear , in these eight years , the weather , substantially changed for us .
we 're <unk> .
we can because the passengers were also not by a fog and fly .
they want you see is something .
and the <unk> or <unk> up in every year , has been working on .

but because this is that 's now that well , has the e.u. , a program on the <unk> to do , almost 10 million dollars , and we 're an essential part of this program .
i 'll get this morning , coming from finland .
this was flying airship on here , and freedom , is a bullet in the lab .
<unk> is the campaign .

that means <unk> <unk> .
and the zeppelin t 's flying in italy , to get up to finland in a <unk> <unk> .
about a lot of a little as it 's the and analyzed the air in the way to <unk> , how she goes on our things that we the ground .
there , so i 've just declared , up there are we just with the other airship on .
a great a great commission .
and it 's when you so i want concrete , '' meaning from the subject of weather .
it 's so very good .
and here are more time a few impressions .
this was flying airship on in sweden , the last week or <unk> week .
and to finland is by the weather 's good , square , <unk> degrees , 30 degrees .
the finns may say something that they had never .
i 've got there are wonderful , nice hot days to teach .
you kill mosquitos who were then you wo n't so bad .
we were also in africa .


i 've got me once asked , you know what do there really ?
and what do we there really ?
the end , we were after two years , then also done .

the entire <unk> came back <unk> and this project was going down .
and a tornado , the zeppelin was in the mast , and then that damaged , that he also going down to be able to .
well , not so bad .
we had a very good industries and they were actually quite pleased .
this was actually looking at the prototype .
and i did n't know what i do with them .
yes , what we now , a very <unk> from the from the little bit .
what we now , it 's when they 've just about , it 's about complexity , it 's about questions , growth or she passes .
what we now do is the <unk> here in <unk> .
we do health maintenance of course .
we 've got to the zeppelin and self-awareness .
<unk> is the aging .
there are usually always be embedded in , after 10 , or 15 it again , the plants need to be .
we replace them are pushing that <unk> for nearly five million dollars .
there with the clients <unk> talk about it 's go .
we do we have the <unk> constantly doing .
we 're an aerospace <unk> mediterranean , the of the germans <unk> and of the european of the controls , and keep getting to and the thing , with ethical review of <unk> also , or how it 's an airbus .
this is also <unk> and costs money and always have to keep it may be .
the question is : do you actually stepping forth ?
you want to evolve ?
you make greater <unk> ?
there 's <unk> , unmanned <unk> .
what makes you really ?
you go further into the market ?
you go further into practice ?
and that we have of course , in my day , even try .
and we 've also some <unk> indignity .
how to actually also the <unk> zeppelin -- some <unk> suffered , and once a bust out .
the beginning to the billboard charts and stood still a donation of <unk> .
the population of the german age population has prevented him back then rescued by six million <unk> as a donation , as the fourth airship <unk> was and he basically a bust , has the population with him a donation .

we were in tokyo , <unk> .
we were , and you hear the past , in san francisco to a client .
there was a very much more investor .
two projects , unfortunately , you failed .
so as <unk> .
, we <unk> won .
i 've not an image on , because we that <unk> emblem not yet can show .
but just in america 's <unk> of the first <unk> in the guy to be .
we have three pieces of ticket .
with <unk> do what we like a deal with a partner , the technology , a new .
and this is a huge success , but at the defeat the things .

why was not ?
we know it actually have been .
either was the location , not the right or the passengers had too far <unk> or in america does n't know you <unk> the last 30 forty years , the commercials have done .
the ham the people have <unk> , have this was flying airship that have said , <unk> , again a , again a <unk> , the power plug .
there , who did n't realize that 's to <unk> can .
and it was actually doubling pair of hard in marketing , that over to bring : hey , people call , and that flies .
<unk> 's good .
the pilot , thereby upping the year , transport , embrace <unk> , <unk> passengers .
but last year we only <unk> done because of weather .
there 's going to be a half million .
so this is bad .
the zeppelin going <unk> routes here .
it 's the point , the of course is beautiful , when i also when ceos , then i see how the passengers out and , and all laughing and we basically it 's not advertising , because it 's mouth to speak , and again and we about <unk> sold their voucher could have and people say , this is so beautiful , and i recommend it with friends , we know , and who also on going , in the family .
and we are great she had .

you could still more flights to do .

so that is actually also not quite .
so , we also an advertising .
this is a project that point that audi <unk> has .
and an audi tt , that made here with the island <unk> together .
but the <unk> is a difficult to market .
and we have to even sometimes the <unk> imagine : power plug in the meaning ?
we have really smart enough ads , but the internet has many changes , the <unk> about the launch , because the <unk> all of control .
the <unk> is largely <unk> , so there are today is just another 10 active <unk> in the world .
we have three here .
two active , and put that <unk> , three , <unk> bought , 10 percent are actively .
so , then six of 10 .
it means we 're then the market in fact , if it at one is , control .
and hope , it again a future in this way to do .

so <unk> 's nice .
marketing do we also find you .
but we find any customers .
<unk> to do we find great , has a technological .
there 's customers .
this is not permanently .
it 's <unk> , and downs in .
so one such a government takes years until you get a kickback .
and then there are then she 's no .
there 's too funny this effect that easy for and hard to control are .
in any case , that the situation , <unk> , a point in the market , so actually not a market .
but we do on .
it 's an icon of the region .
the <unk> have the power to do this .
they brand just the question : in which way we make it on ?
how much money give us in the market ?
what do what do for here ?
in the shape is this field trials are ?
and i personally , you made me also asked , a way to say , i 'm sort of course of my history <unk> , where where i <unk> <unk> , then the big <unk> , as <unk> has this little <unk> dead , you want , it 's also here to rescue .
i was also even for greenpeace , three years <unk> , when i remembered in vancouver island of course , and this entire <unk> jungle , i 've seen , i was that academia , that i went there was doing well .
and there was a <unk> about greenpeace , the money for innovation , and did n't know what they do with this is , and almost to actually gone are .

and i have for three years from greenpeace and courageous , when <unk> and now i am here in hopes , a long the future in the zeppelin to do .
zero , i right ? forty seconds , i 'm still done , thanks .
<unk>
yes , thank you .
that 's my three penalty points that i 'm going to eighteen minutes to go to .
why we are today in excess , or relative wealth ?
how we come to a soulfulness .
and most of all , what do ?
so what is it 's really ?
we start with our first thing .
the first part is maybe a little depressing .
but it 's also its bells , the challenges to show .
a few years about vermeer 's the more difficult to me , this sort to explain .
that 's a problem have today , you know every child .
that we environmental problems have .

all kinds <unk> are rising exponential increase .
if you see it in a historical , long view , the oil use for example , then it 's a very short , episode in the story to be .
the moment , we can not imagine that this kind of different , to use again and keep up .
you know the climate change , the last <unk> years .
some people say , well , once there was a <unk> , let 's the last <unk> years of .
that you can also <unk> look , love ' i also , right .
you can say , who needs because the glacier ?
you can say , the ocean is far away .
but it 's going on , if you just a little bit closer , so busy , to sort of the real challenge , about things that it really about avoiding that is otherwise , we 've just difficulties in the <unk> , at the health .
<unk> is there a few days over 30 degrees .
and there 's degree '' in our cities like in vienna , or <unk> of becoming increasingly more of bad .
it 's but also about the <unk> , especially in asia .
think about the himalayas , where the big jets come and the <unk> of them on that there , changing the water from the himalayas is .
it 's the end , not about the planet .
the planet is that <unk> , what we do , there was pretty much larger environmental crisis .

it 's about loss of biodiversity .
the deserts , to have a payoff .
and drag it will still less .
this is the aral sea , where an essential part of cotton , from .
and this , where that come from ?
all these bad things , let’s just . '' i time , depend on the one or another form with the global <unk> together .
with that we 've come from the earth , what we harvest .
not only that the oil and the metals together and the minerals , but also the renewables commodities are going to renewable , but after all real problem .
and we should just look at that we as few of rising of the fuel , to be in the end of waste and the emissions to produce .
so it goes around , this is in the introduction , said already been the entire <unk> really dramatically to reduce .
this is the challenge , not only climate , not just a c , oh , two , <unk> by a car on a different , but really different way of life .
the way that economies .
our technology essentially entirely new to change .
if we still a look at the hunter and hunting , and there are still on the earth societies that in principle that life , come with a ton of resources in the year per person and year .
in a <unk> it was then in the winning streak , the human history , three to five million tons .
now , there are six to <unk> .
so <unk> , this <unk> .
and he 's very , unequally distributed around the earth .
it 's in north of more than with us with us more than in the earth 's portable , is .
and in other parts of the world , you look in africa , much less .
and to come , we are the implications for us , the rivers , the air is much better from there in the last decades , but it is fundamentally wrong about , that we were in other parts of the world shifts , .
and the other parts of the world , that , but increasingly less like .

and this is there is there 's very colorful , which means , there are many resources , there , where the <unk> the world are .
so if we do with clean up to , then we need to the subject to .
so we have to change , the ecological limits what we 're everywhere , the <unk> 's everywhere .
and that , what we start with this <unk> life , is not <unk> .
that has been of mahatma gandhi , when he said , the world has enough for everybody needs , not for everybody greed .
and there we are , like us here on average life on a lot about .
so .
this was the sort going to be part .
but i find whatever that you the needs to understand it was worth it 's , what to change .
even if i 'll would say , it worth it also like this , different way of life , which is more a soulfulness .
but it is yet again and you know , from beyond <unk> you need , but a rationale , let’s just . '' i time .
so , which is actually a soulfulness .
and so we have guessed that we 're in our face of the world and so much have reached the economically , be centered on the quality , on standard for us on average people often do n't comfortable .
here 's a pretty good as things , but there are people , and you 've got mains as humans , who do n't so good can deal with this story .
i whistled even wrote down there .
<unk> and climate change , the same cause .
we 're too much and to continuously .
this is the one hand , we get ourselves in the stress , and eventually it 's too much .
i work too much like to .
and on the other side to try and we just this <unk> .
what is then a good life ?
how we can be defined ?
now here 's sort of a a little piece of scientific break .
and that time i 've said , and what i 'll say , is scientific body of necessarily valid , but it there 's just looked at that , how i was the tarmac at first time , defined ?
and there 's important , to understand better life has always two aspects .
the quality , the aspect of the objective conditions as it got to go , what i to eat , .
i was a roof over the head ?
i was friends ?
i was a relationship , i can be alive to participate ?
but , you how it 's me with , how do 'official ' i myself to manage it ?
i <unk> ' that sometimes the perceived to quality .
and then <unk> ' i two concepts franchise , at the right there are important .
this is responsive .
the needs are the very fundamental level of our human flourishing , our there is it ai , to feelings .
if we need to fix , then we 're happy .
and we want you ca n't say , needs are unsustainable , or not sustainable .
need per se , not yet to <unk> .
what 's needs ?
you can tell various researchers have to quote , i stuck here 's only two called .
and you see , of the physical needs , but also need for safety , for social relations .
in fact , for participation , to enter , for creativity , to spirituality , for freedom .
it 's a little thing with money to do .
but a lot of just did n't actually , but the question is , how can i that in my life to set .
so , i 've done in the other important term .
the strategies .
the strategy that i 'm going to me to draw stands for me that needs to be happy .
and there 's then it ai that i can sort of high <unk> or a very low <unk> do .
because i can be much money , or some money you need .
strategies that are just my behavior like i mean needs <unk> .
this did with my boxes according to do , with the resources , with the possibilities that i have .
if i have some money , i 'm ' i feel like my needs to try , to summarize it as if i sort of money on the bank account , .
it 's talk about the <unk> , this is the roof over the head , to eat , and then sort of the <unk> .
and here 's happening in its bells , it with a lot sooner or a little <unk> , it sort , or <unk> be .
and if we all the strategies that i have available to talk about my needs of course , for you then we talk about a lifestyle .
so .
this was the sort of break .
and now is it ai n't know what we can do now ?
how it 's how does it ?
and just a couple of reference .
obviously has this sort of the way everybody to themselves will find .
but the references from the individual 's kind of a technological way , here is , i made ' i , a lot also about technology has talked up and finally , also on a political way .
what we can do ?
what we can do ?
what we do ?
so , where we want to go ?
the slides , the verge have sort said , the danger is that we sort of getting more affluence and more resources to use .
after all the quality of back down , because the effects of getting worse , sort , and on us in the end user back to beat them .
or , whether we do it , sort of , because in a different direction , who have fewer <unk> , maybe even with less than consumption , but with a higher quality that are connected .
there 's one of my <unk> , maybe you know , some , <unk> of <unk> of this topic <unk> , so much better life with less <unk> .
there 's a lot of technology like i can see every single thing that here we use the computer , the orange juice , the coffee in the car , the traffic , how can i think that make ?
and cement , i can today , unlike coal production , i can that comes from wood to build , etc. , etc .
around with a much less <unk> more or the same quality to assemble .
my other teachers , <unk> <unk> has this so noble , the <unk> per <unk> , and we 're at the , which today , you ever been talking about was drawn , there 's very deep field on it to look .
where are actually the needs ?
that services , i can actually fix this ?
and how can i that with as little <unk> do ?
and it 's not a little bit less , but with <unk> , <unk> , those percent less .
there are many examples of the this sort of it can .
in vienna , is a building be built to have been allowed .
with seven percent allowed is it in <unk> already built .
that in essence of wood has persisted .
that you , if you maybe there in fifty years , no longer need to break , and then again in its parts and not like , so that sort of very much less valuable resource consumption with everything else , are you there was sort of the moment with the half and the goal is a fifth of <unk> , the span of the house designed with the fifth of <unk> long enough .
it 's but also a lot in our own , sort of , <unk> ' i really ?
elena <unk> has a wonderful book written , <unk> .
where he shows , how hard it in the end is sort of really from the from the sort of <unk> out .
the <unk> , i want to me , so to take off the others come after , and then i 'm sort and be in this in this race in there .
you go there 's sort of entitlement , and i was very satisfied , and then they do 'official ' i was the new .
the most love ' i the <unk> that you know of all .
when i my department was founded was a few years we have a letter writing .
then you have sort of it are able to the letter back up to write like , i can email , you can of <unk> .
to write like , i had hundreds of email .
and there is very much longer afford .
this is productivity , this is economic growth , we are going to that .
but i did n't really time it saved .
i 've got to me in a failure done .
but there 's good examples , slow food for instance where i really sort of making the quality and the fame of <unk> in the foreground is paramount .
and with a small <unk> higher quality , .
one of my favorite is <unk> .
there 's book now you get misinformation , that can average person we had in germany , who came about 10 things in the home has .
you can just begun to count .
who had two , three generations of thousands of things , i had servants , the personnel .
they have us who managed properly .
we need to myself , so , .
and getting fewer people come up so clearly , with these all options .
and we need a guides that we 're going to help , the us and <unk> with these few things go .
about vermeer 's made ' i really interesting , maybe is also can use the spaceship that we 're going to , that 's him , i also not thousands of things like .
the next example is use instead of gold .
a huge boom .
the star , <unk> , <unk> , you might vanish in 20 years in in alternative , we are that 's been .
in the meantime , there are more and people , if you to <unk> think .
if you to <unk> think .
platforms , and business the easy to work , what about the things that we 've got this lovely <unk> here , the a few hundred years ago was built a sort of course , and more about the other related to use it 's about the end .
that even invested was just better to use .
this is the end , as an issue of justice .
so i showed you before you know how all this is they assume that as a picture of africa and europe and a a fair world .
you know that all the same with these resources to do is only then as possible , if we can use less .
and that is this is not going to quality , because of us , jesus , it sort of did .
but it 's an important task of the economy , the company , these products , those services to actually available to imagine that we need to be a good life to do with a much less resources .
last thing that 's also something with the big public policy to do <unk> after the growth , <unk> ' i was the time .
if you a little attention to the projections to read that 's degree , from the oecd , <unk> , now that <unk> every week are these projections back down to change .
it means , yes , a crisis is the door to my view , and also to scale , what we put a great deal with the economists have been talking and so busy , here is the numbers of austria , you find that basically for all across tremendous growth going to go down .
and it 's no reason to grow to have , the way that i do this from my youth , from the years , you know .
a part of this in those reasons .
one point five percent growth is today , so much like eight percent growth of fifty years .
and that eight percent is that , what china to have .
they 're also about there , where we might vanish in fifty years were .
there , if the pie bigger , of harder to eight percent of his game .
this one percent is still much , so we 're good living .
but we have to sort of it up , that means that could n't even if we are zero percent growth would , it would that yes , in the next year precisely such a lot to produce and consume and incomes , as in this year .
we ca : good to invest and so we can work .
this is that as well , did not so powerfully wrong , because you get these statistics , if you know , the show that growth on long been ' danzón no longer with the quality water right .
the economy grows , but the quality of stays in in <unk> countries around on this , on the we are .
and actually also jobs are also , without growth happen and this is n't so intimately locked together , like this is always going to sort of <unk> and as you all you want to you will .
it 's just not and then you to be time with the economics to .
and it 's coming again and more and that 's also <unk> like a form or next week , i made ' i , in comes in the trend , a larger story with that start on , which one .
it <unk> , edward , under armour , the then-director nobel peace in his <unk> that we found myself that he said , the good life the good business , the good economy <unk> <unk> the good life .

in peru , and those countries , also for china , for india there is that can completely different story .
and this is going to just going to be under <unk> , if we there were still growing , and we just sort of this level , on this high level , on the we 're good to live and economies .
and as we need to be policy .
it takes bit lofty goals .
it takes some indicators , say the economists .
it does n't just sort of the growth , but we should actually look , and measure and ask , what about actually work with the quality , up to ?
is the declining ?
and also our politicians to measure .
of course , what 's the <unk> ?
how does it basically put together ?
we need a most fundamental aspect of course , the <unk> finally able to make more and not the work .
who of them in the doctors , among them , but also the worker , you know that very good .
what they kind of control , irrespective , we know , at a colleague in the research has .
that you could be able to do differently .
the resources are sort of reduces and therefore , the resources to put and not the work .

this is , but because you have to sort of a little bit better .
that go to conclude , more or less , on all levels , in this direction and worked , we can do better , we can be a company with the products , services as a consumer sort of us to ask , what we need are actually , how we do this what 's sort of good for us ?
what we need and what we need it might not ?
the politics and vote , the framework set .
a couple of reference i 've been .
and after all of the science <unk> percent of science that 's still in the direction , how we can grow and stimulate compassionate ?
, but nobody had done .
if you the projections look at if you , so this at the last 20 years , it 's always looking down because it 's about .
the politics does n't and the science is n't grow and create , but this is the question how we go to talk about , which is that 's a good life of that ?

be the change you <unk> to lake .
with heart , the brain , hand and after all the spirit we 're going to do .
thank you .
i 'm <unk> <unk> .
and i love this town .
this town , so many stories to tell .
one of it has a few hundred years happened .
and has to do with creative problem-solving .
and creative problem-solving and i 'll explain , and on the story about later .
they will have to deal with the <unk> .
this is can <unk> , and here in the middle of the city , and lots of this city , and thriving and teaching .
another story about earlier .
it was on a hot summer in went , nevada .
a guy called the way that once in his shoes that right there right <unk> .
that with him , 's warm .
he 's europeans , he knows that 's not so with the heat .
he 's so one he pulls the shoe of it takes a knife <unk> not too long is pure , which is a few times makes it has a lot of holes in .
he pulls the shoe , again to put his army knives and forth , he has a kind of climate in shoe .
it 's the shoe , the gulf stream , born .
and this number that you see here is the spot in the forbes list of creating on the morton <unk> today is .
a company is <unk> emerged , with four letters .
the one or some of you know it .
he 's the original idea nike even and being offered .
both have a conference .
so he says , well , <unk> , i put my own business .
<unk> it goes on the stock market .
in in today , several thousand collaborator on just three hundred of businesses in about <unk> the world .
so much for a creative problem-solving .
why not something new management , which is not yet there is ?
and mario question , maybe the question is turned the to <unk> the animal gets .
if you <unk> n't know , it 's what is that was an opportunity ?
this question that 's what i 've often get that in difficult situations .
if something wrong a fluke is , or my collaborator system , and me or engineering n't work or whatever it .
<unk> , little bit , <unk> .
what is that was an opportunity ?
and i ask you get from <unk> the <unk> .
what the difference can <unk> ' i do with this example here to illustrate .
and it 's another example , of the franc furniture included a period , which is the <unk> find out of <unk> .
and the core , like creative people who can be , if it for their own your insurance does .
i want you a few examples here are .
who are so actually so , which was at the franc furniture and that has it also a commercial .
i love ' the awesome .
my son has the woman does n't <unk> .
he 's just <unk> , this is the woman in the <unk> <unk> .
or i had the whole day , plants , independent as i was the intersection had reached , grew up all the bush in my node and i was the other vehicles do n't see .
very clearly , who this guilt is , right ?
the boonies .
the <unk> are <unk> .
i 'm <unk> been , and two times nearly died .
because they can see me , but at this half <unk> in on .
the last thing i was at the crash was n't blame .
blame , the young woman in <unk> .
if you 're a man , each other statement obsolete .
if you , but a woman , you can you know it anyway , not .
so people are creative , we 're creative .
and i wish , and i dream of that we all over one of creativity to use .
many of us are in a <unk> <unk> .
and this must not be like that .
why not things just do differently ?
and he 's important things that we do , the present there have become that we may already kind or <unk> , the opposite .
why the not just do differently , that <unk> , as a little simple <unk> .
and there are so <unk> companies that are using this .
for example <unk> , they speculate that <unk> of their leaders , these signs , or at the wall , for example , and it says then maybe so what it .
as a way , right ?
a coffee order to be rather than the <unk> .
or so what .
we have n't available , <unk> you .
is already today not , right ?
if you the phone , not something they can .
or eat them with me , otherwise , starving , we both .
rude , but as creative .
so we need something 's .
i about getting tired of the client or an environment and then go , and say , okay , that i like .
this <unk> ' i fell .

once the sport , once the global news , once upon politics .
if you there are three times on the pot , is you <unk> .
even got the complaint about too long <unk> the food .
it 's a <unk> building and this restaurant , very small , so i had the chefs take all shook hands of to do .
it was too close .
they 're about , collectively , what we do ?
how we 're solving the problem ?
we can not faster , in the kitchen .
this idea is to form .
in any picture is a somebody <unk> <unk> set of fresh olive oil , salt , pepper , and a <unk> .
so that comes to the environment where it on here we eat their <unk> ever known themselves wo could .
just going to the way .
a creative idea , and perhaps with the <unk> solved .
there 's a person who does a currently not particularly popular .
you this person is the leader who <unk> , so the <unk> the <unk> .
and now <unk> yes , the german trajectory .
in the second day , that takes a monday , so four days .
a company has <unk> <unk> to the staff of the month elected , and you know you may already , which .
a <unk> says , rather <unk> , we thank you .
the people come to us to book <unk> .
the buses , is full , it 's car business leaders , people together to match because each of course , after another , because it is , of a , to b to come .
but why do n't put it is something , and creative , from his terrible thing to do ?
sometimes it happens is creativity also <unk> .
and it comes from a <unk> perhaps , like the company that you may know .
so we have known that it 's where the <unk> n't really goes well , but you to look at the <unk> and even saving is we have but something rather alarming .
or the <unk> in the car .
there , we know , the different , <unk> , and all possible directions .
yes .
why not be a piece of the suburbs the car , testing , if you <unk> it 's right ?
or at <unk> it 's also find ways , the creative to build .
and all that has to do just with humor , with happiness , with it 's stupid , square ?
it 's funny .
once was my <unk> son with me the office .
and sitting on this <unk> before me .
so , we have multiple <unk> around the <unk> .
and then poignancy turns it from left to right , he 's delight , and i when i would all <unk> tell him . '' to you , listen to , this is not a playground here .
he to me , look at me , big eyes staring me , a playground .
and in the moment <unk> ' i actually , they are right , right ?
why is that 's not a playground today ?
why is that , what we do , not the playground for grown-ups ?
this about vermeer 's sort of it made , right ?
if we are relaxed , if we our talents , do that , what we like to do .
and so though we are , but it the way .
this curious thing is that , if a particular day , the week , then is what in our brains .
it 's the first day on the week , and somehow it 's our focus on another one day .
so one other day , we usually prefer them .
so in the weekend .
and that we also been on the media .
the <unk> is yes , only one day to the weekend .
or if then the nicest day of the year announced , the vacation .
what are then the rest <unk> weeks of the year ?
it is that dreadful ?
we 've all so , jobs ?
a <unk> it had a time on the page for wonder , this topic .
yes , monday , is nothin ' i and the rest of life , you ask ourselves .
or on <unk> , on facebook , all over the social networks is this topic taken .
once was i went through the <unk> , one of the <unk> in <unk> .
these are many terminal centers and i look at the likes to begin .
what have the way in the <unk> , which there 's this ?
and one day <unk> i think of this business with these to give to buy .
and the first of sign that you see here , yes , this is actually quite neat .
so , of the love to do instead , to work .
i <unk> that as well , well , my father of five kids , but i love as my work now .
yes .
or still working for <unk> this just outsource sign .
why this personal belief that , because the amount of ideas , which is , more and and forth .
somebody has since time as an answer to that direction <unk> it 's not the monday , there are your jobs .
and i wonder , even in fact , with the pink , glasses , here spinning forward , and say , okay , ' time thinking .
what on my job is beautiful ?
this silly , even though it 's the pink , glasses , it 's all right out of years before .
so something nice to talk , that 's not beautiful is that 's obviously not .
the pink , glasses , is a great for a bike ride .
there 's a wonderful to fly off , who else in your eye into this would .
but to <unk> gets you do n't .
where is us that , if we do n't that change ?
in the job , the content , our <unk> ?
within the company , outside to become more .
it ends , maybe into a system where we have that we feel like the mouse .
the mouse up a in this wheel , and running , and running , and there 's now , and eventually gets ready to quickly , this wheel , it being the poor mouse and they will go out .
what makes the mouse , but it ?
you know , nothing else , she goes back in the thing in the <unk> .
and again , and again , maybe the film and every day acknowledges me , the <unk> , you may yet she falls , soft .
that 's beautiful <unk> here with hay , so they do , yes , because failure and it 's and over again , so there .
and that , what we as funny to think probably has the mouse looking at once a concussion , yeah ?
or something needs to make that <unk> <unk> .
i felt so long ago , so when i grew up was a seminar when home .
and to that was , so the street under me , felt it was black , before my eyes and somehow got to fightin ' i stand .
the next day i went to the doctor , because i thought , which is there on ?
he looked me and said , we that 's physically , everything in order .
but how do it with the <unk> from ?
and i looked into my calendar , to test this , and i saw , i worked for three weeks , through and somehow , whatever i was also the job .
after 20 years in the <unk> and collaborator , and so first in the early been wondering whether we the night before , can do .
i whistled even thought , what is it really what else , for jobs ?
and i started , <unk> , again , other priorities straight to retire , to look at that i time with my family <unk> ' , something good for me , i do .
<unk> ' , whether it 's not can other <unk> are in my job , of the spark off .
i 've noticed that we had a large groups that make me exactly joy .
i do 'official ' at it of advice and seminars and other things , but those talks by pulses be pleased to , experiences , exchange , who prepare me exactly joy .
and that was n't always been so .
i 've got myself recognizing that we need to this <unk> stress with power .
and sometimes need to get this shot of the bug , <unk> of mine is the amount back from the hospital , massacred , after he 's a heart have had and to that it also , <unk> .
sooner than i said , you do with some jogging , he 's me still <unk> , yes , you with your running and so .
today 's it themselves .
so , with <unk> , beautiful slow , in real <unk> , but eventually we be together and so let me .
what happened ?
the bottom line , we 're all the healthier .
the <unk> go down , but a curve , the fluid , is the conditions , because of mental health .
<unk> minus four percent in the time , by the last decade , <unk> almost a fifty percent , that 's beautiful , this is shrinking .
the rise of psychiatric disorders , plus two percent .
this is something , where i think , have this be ?
why is that ?
this is just in austria , that ?
no , even in germany , it 's so .
<unk> , <unk> , this is all the healthier .
that 's so here on the left to recognize .
it down to treat disorders of plus eight hundred percent in the last 10 years , finds a a big german <unk> out .
the number <unk> psychiatric drugs , takes too .
and the cost .
and i want to all kinds of formal , what we can do with this subject ?
do anything about affecting people sometimes they also learned from helpless <unk> , like for example here .
so this is good about .
and somebody was once said , no alcohol of it 's no solution .
but what is then the solution ?
what is then that , which helps us , but again , healthy , and fulfilling and with happiness is ?
and now i was the last year 's busy .
so i think , it 's something like <unk> , can do something that actually be ?
i 'm figure , the job is not that , what we <unk> fulfilling and make you happy to .
there are many other things that are important , family , health think , and so forth .
but the fact , but that we the most of our <unk> in the work to spend .
and if we do so , then why not that do that it 's happy face and also by anything else .
the <unk> <unk> ' i do you <unk> '' as the last still carry this to <unk> and for <unk> to .
these little abbreviated texts that you to hopefully then it easier to do .
<unk> is for him act , liberty and environment .
that is , like <unk> ' i mean , talents ?
in the surroundings do 'official ' i that , even with whom ?
the freedom , ' i here , to do this , what i do want ?
because it 's the amount of <unk> , the us <unk> .
ever more of them , more stress .
and what i do this ?
the execution .
that are these four areas .
and it , everyone to go there is checkable .
i had this for me , vet diagnosed with a few years and i go for us again .
can i mean , talents to use ?
in the environment ?
and that is , sometimes i go , i in a cafe in my laptop , and princeton to prepare , or a <unk> .
the freedom .
the freedom , can i take care about to do this , what i realized that 's important .
and do i 'm doing it ?
the execution .
the last ted u .
and then it 's over and people , the me explain why that does n't go .
and why this at them much harder is .
i figured it 's going to an answer to do that .
who wants to find ways .
who do n't , has the reasons .
and by looking in the point , this can choose the love ' i devised ways , they do 'official ' i think about roads or , ' i reasons why ?
and they 're in both 're right .
what we do so with our talents somewhere else ?
each of you have his great <unk> it .
that is so far too small .
that 's filled with the same talent , with the gold , with all , with their skills .
what do this ?
by the year we wonder that .
or if we in the hospital 's or the end of life .
what i whistled along with my talent , doing ?
incidentally , who here 's really has to <unk> <unk> , like to look here , it .
so , what do with our talent , is so my first question , also clear to myself , which is every day .
<unk> ' i the good enough ?
and resources .
there was yet another thing with a story .
and i wanted to tell about <unk> .
and that <unk> ' i was on the point is still do .
the fortress which was the bailout of the <unk> as a dime about five hundred years , the hostiles were coming .
and the enemy , we realized that that 's a fortress , so well , built was , it was n't look at you could .
thick walls are also wicked way that <unk> to the fortress , thick and doors to get locked , once on .
i was <unk> time .
so i thought , the final thoughts , okay if we do n't get , then we have a <unk> .
we let 's no longer turn out and pure .
let 's like for fairness and that there 's .
the <unk> found it from far the day came , where the supplies of , and then we were .
they only had a <unk> who was already on the way to , eating it to be as the <unk> of the bishop says , the bishop give me that <unk> and give me three days .
bishop okay , <unk> , you have a time , i <unk> ' you , come , hold your <unk> and help us .
<unk> going to <unk> way .
to look down the enemy , how about the wall of the a <unk> i found that will lead happier , again and from left to right and already in the early .
well , think to the , a <unk> , which is that now .
it 's lunch .
again , is a <unk> <unk> , up on the wall of the , this time he is completely black .
enemy was thinking , oh , who has two more <unk> , it could ever seen something even before .
the night the same experience more time , this is he knows the <unk> , the there , and downs in a result is .
the end of the second day , after the six different <unk> have seen the bottom , they pulled in a <unk> off .
because they thought that takes us too long , that we hold on myself to come out .
after the <unk> down to <unk> and <unk> the <unk> .
the one , the they had and the they 're planting trees have .
it 's the <unk> <unk> to form .
i like this idea that all right there is , what we need , and that we have everything .
sometimes dies , it narrowed resources , it 's not much , it 's a little bit .
but also so we can now , but do something .
we have no idea of the power that we have the world every day of trying to innovate .
and if you think that could now a good <unk> be you should have been right .
in the spring from the spring .
the beep .
and we in the trogontherii know that disappears into the snow , there 's going to get there are the growing plants from teens brown <unk> to green <unk> to be .
there are blooms at least arise from these blooms of the crop .
there are an apple here a popular and then we harvest and eat .
there 's grain of this grain could we will grind it makes bread for baking .
there are there any animals that they eat .
there are some people that the products just take it to grow food .
and it 's automatically .
but when you think about that probably do n't like them automatically translates everything is that 's a 's a fear and so anxious .
and of is this threat , maybe just very ambiguous and also very theoretically , but just the domain of these blooms , the connection of the flower to plant are bees fly a very , major part .
there are fringe research , the show that to <unk> percent of our food , in time to do n't there were as if we do n't make bees have .
and that , it sounds so <unk> , because it 's natural for us , and we maybe bees do n't all that sense .
there was now thinking of time also a very interesting movie , <unk> , the subject .
and i recommend you , you look to you .
now , but you know , we look at the lord <unk> the universe is now with honeybees are working , the in his high school , in <unk> the importance of bees can do .
that makes it here at a high school at <unk> and he gets us now some of his work to tell .
please , mr. <unk> .
yes , good evening .
first time , a big thanks to mr. <unk> and at the whole <unk> .
that i here with my project , <unk> and more <unk> something about it 's about the life for the bees .
and also under one wing of <unk> about a little <unk> to tell that 's fun .
because i think of actions that the most of you <unk> to make it would be here tonight is a <unk> do you and hit eighteen minutes in the basics of <unk> bring to go out .
that do i do n't , no .

my name is thomas <unk> , i 'm <unk> years of young , with an incredible wife annie perasa married , father of five kids not yet <unk> and i have different <unk> and a lot be , and work for <unk> years in the <unk> with <unk> adolescents and adults .
i 'm a member in <unk> <unk> now , a group <unk> to <unk> <unk> .
and i 'm now in the <unk> <unk> above of <unk> with our eldest people whose students in <unk> .
we 're there in the garden , in agriculture and in the <unk> .
<unk> is actually a play by <unk> <unk> and it 's about <unk> <unk> .
so my classroom is to a <unk> , a quiet , one of thing .
and they will be able to settle down .
it 's almost a <unk> do .
and not free to have been the ancient greeks the relationship of honey and so <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> and the <unk> <unk> known .
and in a wonderful verse of homer , describes how it looks like the <unk> <unk> his <unk> came to be sleeping poet , go out to use to spark that it comes back to work with you can .
but the <unk> go ahead and i do find ourselves , but they send her to bees and <unk> now the denser the lips , with what makes and they crawl in your mouth on and back out with him later , the words like the honey from the <unk> flow .
a beautiful picture .
i do these to me tonight .
yes .
this flying classroom .
i come to the project .
one of <unk> , this <unk> the only now my students with me , have built , for 30 kilometers until <unk> days in a <unk> .
in <unk> schools of us in <unk> the high school or in the <unk> in the <unk> of <unk> or in the <unk> to <unk> .
a <unk> to <unk> or in classrooms will we had in <unk> .
the teacher , the project that accompanied by going to me in the class , and we 're looking for a times square , for such a <unk> .
most of the windows so the kids do something can see during this month .
and most of all things , with the bees , and then in there are moving across the tube , out and again <unk> can .
there is then the window onto a hole and prosperity .
so .
and then begin in the whole with me on the <unk> .
i 'm so a <unk> and jump , '' now from an existing <unk> two <unk> out and i 'm now here in these <unk> in .
so important in this image on this <unk> are <unk> so the bees .
also important , what we have <unk> migrate north , and here to the edge , the freshness of america migrate to be , so fresh eggs .
and then you a <unk> , up here .
there 's the honey is inside .
the need them , if a bad weather , and they 're not able to fly .
so .
this is how come out .
then , <unk> here again , it , and begins immediately the transportation depended on the for <unk> where , or at the for <unk> place in school .
and now it 's another thing .
ladies and gentlemen , these bees in there and then in the class are living through all of a crisis .
her people 's no longer .
they are lonely .
they find your queen did n't .
and this is the most important task from <unk> , when he made this <unk> things that he happy to pay attention that the queen the old people 's left .
there 's not so on both these <unk> sitting .
and they 're sad , these bees .
they 're starting to <unk> .
yes , the <unk> says , they <unk> .
you hear that .
they do n't know , almost a <unk> higher than if you normally in your <unk> with a queen 's coming together .
and now starting a <unk> .
ladies and gentlemen , in a night , they develop all right now the necessity , a new people to , and the whole thing happened without <unk> , <unk> , without looking at conferences , without having conversations , without the opinions and post-doc positions .
so , the people to agree and it forms , then in the first night , there in a <unk> .
because without the queen going to this nation after six weeks , no longer exist .
because <unk> live only six weeks of .
so .
and the first night , get them from one of <unk> a pin out an egg , and bring this in this <unk> in .
and into it is then can see the queen going .
everybody , the of you <unk> in the high school , says , how is that go ?
yes , g.m <unk> , but that 's all genetically <unk> .
this is true .
and now it 's another thing .
this an egg , which is normally in the <unk> a worker was going into the <unk> a queen .
the egg , the first three days of the same genetic code , like the <unk> .
and it will be fed by a <unk> figure .
you know this concept .
and immediately is changing on this <unk> on <unk> imagine the genetic code .
the <unk> 're going through the <unk> in the <unk> figure it changes .
that we had that ever heard that , what we eat , that , i know what kind of us will .
and the queen is that really wonderful to experience .
three days and egg , five days <unk> .
and that can the students , barbaric practice .
you see that in class .
and then becomes the cell <unk> with a , there 's what and the whole thing happens then also not , because , the nation with a democratically in making a decision , or because one <unk> says , this is it be , or you <unk> a group saying , you do this now .
no , that happens <unk> .
ladies and gentlemen , this is a <unk> or a <unk> that .
and then count the challenge is eight days , each of my student knows , three , five times eight a queen 's so <unk> days that the queen the moth .
and the day , if that 's going to happen to , the teacher , it down into the <unk> there <unk> the an alarm in the youngsters under the morning about five o'clock , yes .
and then he says the mother , let’s just , which is because you through this ?
yes , i have to school .
yes , why that one ?
yes , your queen the moth .
yeah ?
and then there are the morning about six in school .
and then hit the your <unk> down ? at this <unk> , because they barbaric want , like the queen and now the moth .
and if you have the real experience , then hear you first thing .
the queen , she .
so .
a little bit higher .
and then , the <unk> and cutting the queen going free .
the first , what the queen , they spread her wings come out and are now with their <unk> that people what to myself a queen i found that has their , you <unk> , of pheromones .
the nation has now , an identity .
now are three to five days for the queen is fed orally .
of the <unk> forward , but what you your <unk> figure .
back there 's a bat out , from the people , from this <unk> .
and after five days over the queen and singular of the <unk> out .
others think now , yes , i 've ever seen , such a <unk> in <unk> .
you know , this means .
what 's completely different .
-- that we let me .
the queen the flying now by ourselves without <unk> , without even invited to , from this <unk> out to two miles high .
they 've probably ever seen in the zeppelin .
in the <unk> point , and there in an unpredictable <unk> now <unk> , of seven or twelve drones , the male bees .
so the way , like in islam , where the man different women have to this is the queen , the seven to a dozen men has .
and this whole thing happening in a wonderful way in flight .
the drone along comes from behind <unk> the queen , and the queen , what happens now in this gave the mating flight all that , what about being needs to three years of the eggs to get away .
for the drone is it also an amazing experience .
if it 's done with the <unk> dies , you and when he died from the sky .
and then comes the queen and back and starts , eggs to get away .
there are always a , two students in the class that it immediately see .
and also see immediately the queen .
yes .
and ends up the project in school because now , the <unk> again <unk> and the queen and the <unk> is that now to live in there .
and then -- i one night , and perished prior to this <unk> .
<unk> ' that <unk> the outside , and the next morning to jump , i these <unk> with the queen and these bees to me on the <unk> .
and you see here 's the queen .
yes .
it 's fresh <unk> .
and around the 10 to 12 <unk> .
and then come , these two <unk> are now here in a <unk> .
in a cane , in a particular prey and now , that people the size and powerful forces are .
why the bees in school ?
ladies and gentlemen , the kids that have seen , forget that never more .
yes .
there is not just like that in this class , then the students all the time with the bees 're together , but the entire school , yes , in this class in .
and the teacher , if he 's something you know , if he 's something , when he said , if he was there something for the future has the can a time after the other join .
look , bees and can human history of <unk> years we 've paintings , where the people around the honey harvest , .
a few months , you have in israel , for example of years old <unk> found in which the people then the bees , that i have .
any human culture has to bees flying together .
or vice versa , the bees were at any culture in .
in china , in india to persia , in egypt , in greece in rome .
so they were in .
the human life , ladies and gentlemen , are passed .
he 's a <unk> , a <unk> do is , he 's a <unk> join .
ladies and gentlemen , you know that have flowers , or grafting trees , the bees <unk> , what they need ?
you coming out there 's something , now in summer in agriculture .
this out there , this is a green desert for our bees .
yeah ?
he can find ourselves with the students in the gardening classes come and flowers and plants , bees are able to , the <unk> you mark and look , how long need the right away from <unk> to my kids flowers ?
how long , they 're on the individuals blooms .
and how long , they need , until they come back .
he can can <unk> craft .
how <unk> i a hexagon ?
yes .
you know , whether this is that in the <unk> the top up , or you can flat panel , up that is ?
so look at what 's just carefully .
he 's a mathematics -- , a <unk> join .
yes , ladies and gentlemen , it can go to the youngsters under even the <unk> <unk> on these <unk> find .
and then it comes to the question , as iucn was karl from newly <unk> the nobel prize , ever get ?
because he thought , that the bees can see that in the hive .
but , ladies and gentlemen , in a hive , it 's dark .
there 's also a bee has nothing .
and just the professor <unk> , the many years in <unk> at the university teach girls who has to <unk> out that the bees , there a <unk> create a single <unk> .
as a <unk> net of the wax in the <unk> a <unk> create , and now with <unk> hertz , their <unk> in front door , and the bees , the <unk> , to pick up with their legs , with their <unk> .
you see what that bees in school to do ?
it 's <unk> par <unk> , and the kids lose your fear of the bees .
and develop a health care for the bees .
they learn , <unk> , look at that , what the bees do .
and they get a curiously aware of these creatures which is the reason is essentially just for us humans are .
the bees do what do n't even a kilo of a nation in the year .
so <unk> years , the only way , and candles that there .
they concentrate on the <unk> out of the trees that <unk> .
this is a <unk> , to fix them out of her own people out .
and now suppose we time ago , in summer , that are <unk> -- , <unk> bees in such an inner space , at <unk> degrees .
hey , there 's these diseases , without end .
no , at the bees do n't .
because they were in this <unk> natural antibiotics .
they accumulate the pollen , and i mean that it can ferment , he 's going to <unk> , a level <unk> .
someone who embarked on the <unk> parkinson’s disease is that gets pneumonia <unk> , <unk> the can now going to a <unk> go and a <unk> myself , by looking at the <unk> from the people the collapse .
obviously there is a grid that , and with <unk> with a <unk> and so forth , and i did n't happen .
yeah , and then , ladies and gentlemen , and pollinating the it has been doing that the bees , as well , and we have a few apples , if the bees and i did n't fly would sooner or we 'd like chinese is just on the <unk> <unk> and they themselves locally .
there 's much more common .
and look at the <unk> , out there on the meadow and he is also the growing on the trees , where the cows graze again .
and over the bee , you bring to culture takes nectar and it 's fermented -- these <unk> .
and this is the cow and eats the <unk> and just , because they <unk> <unk> nanotubes , they digest .
yeah ?
and then <unk> you go back and forth , ah , yes . i 've <unk> <unk> , ah , i can do it again <unk> .
and then there 's milk .
that makes the bee .
yeah ?
and the last but not provided the bee 's the most valuable , what it on the content from nature 's .
the honey .
i 'd just a the point , <unk> .
my students celebrate , every year when you these <unk> build and then , with me up in the schools and go .
that 's now , not my <unk> but once i had a student in 1948 and i said in <unk> in high school in <unk> and i 've said , you , <unk> 's put you get themselves before .
and then he says , yes , i hot . '' <unk> <unk> .
i come out <unk> at <unk> and i 'm twenty-one years .
and i 'm for five years in <unk> and for two years ago when thomas demarse at <unk> .
and i 'm tired me that i now , no longer with the <unk> have to learn , but with your hands can learn .
<unk> , yes , with the head .
and a <unk> went through the <unk> , and hit a high school .
and more than half the said , oh yes , that we want to be .
my high schoolers so what an appreciation and all between , in , quote , normal and the <unk> people get through the bees , salvaged .
on the field , you , and they get in consciousness , my students and a proud .
how can you to the bee network ?
the question is wrong .
you have to say , how can you to <unk> the <unk> ?
and there , darling , i , as well , because it 's the person , the other people <unk> and it 's a new <unk> are .
and he says , so , we got to .
the end of a little verse of <unk> of <unk> .

thank you .
hello , dear friends on earth .
so welcome to talk from my project .
this project , my sighted person and my wife .
it 's the fight for an end of the female genital mutilation .
in my view , the greatest crimes of man , because it there been for five thousand years .
the society against the women with a six to sacrifice every day .
first <unk> ' i think .
my name is <unk> , i come in hamburg ?
and i <unk> years a <unk> the sun .
you can think that me the job , not <unk> has .
and i do n't <unk> .
so , i was glad that i said in the subject <unk> good <unk> and exciting stuff pull back .
for example , this .
with a massive <unk> about the about africa , after brazil .
on the sail a spoken plea on the <unk> brazil in the impending genocide in the last <unk> indians from the <unk> , to prevent .
it was a ride , where i more <unk> was as <unk> , more <unk> as <unk> .
but participants were like that have been wired , this the media to find and even a small person like i could express your priority worldwide according to represent language of them .
<unk> i whistled along with my own moves across the <unk> in ethiopia <unk> .
then there was there 's war in eritrea , and ethiopia and we were <unk> of the killings , there .
and despite all the cruelty , that we 've had , we saw on the other side of the infinity hospitality of the <unk> that we <unk> <unk> , arab hospitality .
and then two colleagues did it that we busted down , and we got invited to that you see here , reconnecting with their bodies as living up to before us <unk> , and to provide said that 's my magical spell .
if you who kill you want to their teleconsultation with us through it shoot .
something like i did n't in different culture , i found .
and then ran into years before , i learned that you conceptualize islam , not can reduce to terrorism .
and christians do n't mean you can be on their terrorism .
for example , the <unk> .
the inquisition , the <unk> .
but rather on the real value of charity , social responsibility , the <unk> .
this is the values , for the , it 's worthwhile to fight .
after many years , i came back in this <unk> been , combined with my wife <unk> .
and we stopped moving from this <unk> female genital mutilation .
when i then i heard that those percent of our craft <unk> are the way , 're christians and <unk> , ' i thought about how can a <unk> like the reason , besides all of terror and that 's <unk> in the shoes out of divorce ?
and the idea was born in the highest in africa of islam we to bring the need to sin to explain .
we were looking for this arms at the germans , organizations that we have to be found .
so let 's going to do now we would be yes , up completely <unk> , the reason that was n't <unk> .
you would i the throat ribbons .
on <unk> for amnesty , mit , then we have <unk> our own web consortium called amyris .
and they were of <unk> and <unk> independently .
and now to this battle and actually win to do we needed a picture .
it was a scarcity .
and so moved <unk> and i went back in this desert to deal with the hidden camera these pictures of doing .


what you 've left is an opening of the size of <unk> .
urinating and have a now one single .
if they generally get you get them to take two weeks .
, you look at body and soul , to live in their dignity .
this was the beginning of so-called <unk> <unk> .
in the <unk> 's happening on .
the man has it up .
he has never had a <unk> woman has seen .
so peculiar , he said , oh , ibrahim muteferrika , but that 's no problem .

and if you do n't it can , of it 's not bad .
then take you that knife and <unk> you on .
this is <unk> <unk> .
and dies a third of the girls .
that nobody had to three months , and mutilated .
in shock , the girl the lost .
this is the <unk> , even some in asia .
the most people are the islamic is king .
and whenever we muslims were wondering , why you have that done ?
i was the <unk> answer that we need to do , this is in the koran .
nothing is in the koran always talking about , quite the opposite .
and i sincerely believing <unk> times per day in prayer , as business opportunity , allah , the creator , is , perfect , <unk> .
but they do n't seem to believe , so what you pray .
they assume , allah , a <unk> to be the women 's wrong , has created and why you just as <unk> person <unk> could , on women <unk> .

he <unk> us , his whole <unk> <unk> to a conference .
there 's ass kickin ' conversations , for two days .
but we had the health in on our side , the highest <unk> on our side .
and yet , the great that , the practice is against all rights , against the religion , we need to oppose interracial marriage .

and you put africa and the <unk> if you know , you know , only that has to these people are valid .
and it became hard , and these things we had then also in other countries .
quick example , all there <unk> us the first one , the <unk> of the country his message that it 's a crime is , at tooth fairy to write and that now in the <unk> to wear .
for weeks , we were traveling , with transport for camels .
200 or tooth fairy , we had in .
and where we thought , we 've just open your ears , open arms and the historical sayings , saints hospitality , '53 .
and when we do this country gets to leave you wanted , i said , the great scholar and <unk> <unk> , you want now actually all <unk> countries it ?
so much life , allah , you do n't give .
he 's right .
i 'm <unk> and because you have been slow to do is coming .
and most of all , he had an idea .
he said , if you accomplish , the ten <unk> muslims at the world to a table to take out and explain the need to sin , then it 's a sin .
<unk> and i flew over cairo summed up in the <unk> and -- the mosque , comparable to tell you will the <unk> .
and in <unk> for <unk> quite the <unk> , his <unk> professor , ali <unk> we got one <unk> .
he listened to the idea of was thrilled , of all , when we him make that we finance this would .
and we do that just about this , the support us .
and then he said , i 'm going to the conference , not just <unk> , like us to being asked them , but i 'm going to the <unk> over .
and that he did .
over cairo <unk> at the year <unk> our government transparent .
international <unk> to ban the <unk> of the female parts of your body through the female circumcision .
the <unk> of <unk> professor , ali <unk> .
and all these are they come .
a hundred invited to , but the highest in the world .
in the middle <unk> in qatar , the man has <unk> in hamburg , and the rest of europe , he 's the cause of <unk> because of cartoons .
so men who live and death can decide .
but also the other .
the left the <unk> <unk> , right , the <unk> , my <unk> .
the highest in the world .
over which is <unk> me just a vacuum ago , allah , personally .
and i figured it all of a place .
it started the conference .
and under our sign at the <unk> of links <unk> of egypt .
the <unk> <unk> the <unk> egypt , <unk> of a woman , mubarak and <unk> <unk> , germany .
so much for the topic that islam is not <unk> .
we did you could be the on their way to . <unk> , which has happened to women and gills , with the <unk> .
and then one <unk> your film shows , <unk> .
reality .
the men had wet eyes .
they went to come back behind <unk> doors to just two hours , you had decided , and one , fatwa , writing , a <unk> .
the <unk> kick in the cameras , announced , what we decided they did .
and the most important set in it , it was this .
female genital mutilation , is a <unk> crime rate for its value of islam engagement .
he signed the , fatwa .
we thought , the job is done , but the calculus , without our hosts .
because the shame , over the abdomen , the woman to talk , is stronger -- stayed forever than any mind .
so we <unk> .
we have this , we 've been recorded in that we call them , the book .
a <unk> to promote the world .
and because ali <unk> , the <unk> , it so well , i found that book , he 's it with a `` co was blessed .
it 's going to us from the hands and that means .
we were in many countries had arrived at conferences , do with the ecm in the top clergy like .
and they were reading this with interest in some were so excited , you to this book , stands to have .
unfortunately , but we have the most of the courage to put that well as to announce that .
over the abdomen , the woman you 're not in the mosque to talk .
just some have the courage to put them .
they 're at least in the universities , and left , on the market .
and sometimes we have some had that promote found that actually in the mosque , about <unk> , like here .
and then it goes out of speakers in the <unk> .
and this is yes , the subjects .
and it will spread .
but i am running the of time .
there are all drop in the hot rocks , and so i 'm working on a lot of strategies , this topic , <unk> .
the practice , and .
but my <unk> this would have this .
i want to the great to contextualize the highest clergy like the world . announce the birthplace of islam actually here at the kaaba , in mecca .
not in such <unk> <unk> <unk> , but in the <unk> .
so here four million people together , men and women <unk> islamic modernism .
then <unk> ' i do with all those seven- and the <unk> king of my transparent up there is between the minarets in contract .
and i found that here ever been trained , in the <unk> .
unfortunately , i still the last <unk> , that would be the <unk> king .
but i 'm sure , when he said of <unk> , he would join .
one of these women to help .
the other , to the world time to show , which the real value of islam , instead , all the present to make .
from terrorists than <unk> .
sometimes i do n't create , then <unk> ' i might this , which in hamburg been naturally i had .
that at a lot to promote in the mosque up on earth .
and we transparent and contract , could .
and maybe if i it 's that little girl puts his daughters , no longer the trains to .
then , my life that right off .
and i want motives for anyone who does this anecdotally , or seen , to compete .
it 's not be part is a <unk> .
we need to practice in the that did n't do otherwise , note here i of this stage , not decline .
and now i want them up with the concept of my <unk> been used to show .
this is my <unk> , my <unk> .

down there , we do you also in german .
female genital mutilation , with the koran , and the ethic of islam , incompatible .
it 's <unk> and one of discrimination of islam .
thank you .
thank you .
so , i got tired , so long time .
so , the <unk> out that you as a refugee , in germany , .

and , it <unk> .
my mom was completely terrified , because they did not understand why the us now <unk> dinner gave them .
the third day , we can understand that happened .
we stood in the trash to this stuff back to throw but this was a <unk> wife and i would that easy to <unk> out .
they tried to us to explain , hey , that you can eat .
this is not spoiled before .
it tastes , very good .
it 's the cheese .
my mother drew the present to try and we were laughing .
cheese .
in my own country , we have to <unk> but who has not so <unk> acid .
i 'm <unk> <unk> and <unk> years old .
in 15 years ago , i 'm going to my mother and my brother of china to germany fled .
of escape <unk> ' i do you today .
but of it 's me about , to the people that 's escape it , and a commercial success did .
but first give him . '' i them , where , i 'm from .
i 'm <unk> .
uyghurs are a little <unk> , the northwest of china life .
and this region grows by the chinese that autonomous area <unk> called .
it 's about <unk> miles from germany away .
in china , collectively add 10 million uyghurs and in munich , is the biggest <unk> community outside of china .
and the uyghurs and life , so here because we in china under constant abuses suffering badly need .
hundreds of chinese were extra hard to <unk> relocated , so we in our own home to a minority have become .
our own native language , <unk> was thrown out of education eliminated .
in schools and in university will just a chinese ways .
and our religion can we also do n't go out .
the uyghurs and lose all kinds of their culture and identity .
and if you have any brave , and for the right the uyghurs starts to risk for sentences , torture , or even die .
it was also the reason , why my parents , for you 've decided , with us kids to flee .
this was <unk> and i was 11 years old .
this picture is just before we run tests .
we did n't enough money , so my father had first time to leave .
i <unk> ' at me many people that 's look at the run have helped .
i <unk> ' at me many paintings .
i <unk> ' me , but first of <unk> our <unk> <unk> .
i ' it just before me , when i mean , <unk> .
he was big had can <unk> , and more and we met him to perform with his little <unk> on a lot .
the first rate was printed out .
i know that many of a negative image of <unk> have to run only going to refugees and to do n't for the companies involved in the .
but i 'd like , say , i 'd like , it as <unk> call , not as <unk> .
because <unk> us has conducted months , accompanied .
he stood in the airport in <unk> on a <unk> and has to the last end of looked , whether we also really safe from the <unk> came out .
the airport in <unk> we thought there , and i remember , as my mother of being told me goes straight out of the airport .
is that i 'm not about .
until we out there are .
because i had to go in my hand a stamp and there was also my photo in here , but there was an alien name , <unk> .
i had to <unk> through the <unk> .
and i <unk> ' at me <unk> <unk> the i was he had to stamp my in his hand .
silence .
and sweat .
a long view .
we were able to <unk> .
in munich , <unk> ' i have a lot of the first responders , the us something deeply supported them .
i <unk> ' at me the <unk> woman , the with us in <unk> used to have .
in a <unk> with four <unk> per <unk> 13 family .
at forty children .
a <unk> and a kitchen .
there was stranger whose faces .
and many different languages .
and we did n't have privacy .
my mother , my brother and i had a <unk> share .
there was being eaten , slept and done homework .
friends did , not to visit , because i <unk> , where we resided .
just my <unk> the <unk> in the <unk> knew i mean .
they knew my story and help me , and they had to me .
for example , she brought me to <unk> <unk> what i now to do .
but it helped me as somehow , german other kids know .
i spent all my adolescence in <unk> .
it was for my mother 's not easy .
alone with us kids with her husband and in the uncertainty , because we did n't just a <unk> and they could n't always was deported be .
i <unk> ' me that i very , aggressively , the time .
it 's me also slightly embarrassing , this now there anything to tell , but now , i have to my story to stand .
i was extremely aggressive and i could tell me in school at some way to focus .
they brought us to put them to catholic <unk> where we first time with a normal human children in contact came out .
to take my goodness ' i kids that 's not going to a <unk> it had to .
i <unk> ' me about the <unk> the me and my brother of who or <unk> to have .
so that we have come out .
i <unk> ' i was also on several <unk> <unk> the with us done homework , because our parents did n't speak german , could .
or who have to us , paintings .
we 've always very happy .
i remember , how we always before the fence , and waited until these people came , because , of course , local people for us time , and they were used to take matters .
after two years , finally got my father to germany .
this problem , but that it comes directly from <unk> to <unk> deported , because it in munich , we have no place , more for him was .
i <unk> ' at me the very , engaged attorney , that it has , my father of the <unk> to china to keep us they did it even notice that he we had in munich , it boasts one .
i <unk> ' at me this period where i really , and then you very , happy , because after six years <unk> could we finally in a standard apartment .
we got a <unk> for three years , and we had finally , with a home with a your bathrooms and one of your kitchen .
and i had actually a room .
it was that is very small and i did n't have desk in , but it was fine , i was my door gates .
and i <unk> ' me that i the time , very well used , but i had been the <unk> without a major corporations .
i looked for me really no way .

first <unk> then the <unk> .
i do you the instructor that are really clear to think there and i was really not just the time i started to it 's actually going to the middle age 16 .
and i came to <unk> .
and before i <unk> , i played by with my best friend <unk> at <unk> .
<unk> is an organization or a lot of organized <unk> .
but i was a <unk> so did ' i also just done because we go through <unk> a place , where we just go to go .
we had a valve that what we aggression <unk> could .
and the ladder of <unk> helped us to somehow that we our problems with him tell you could and help us and i could look at all of questions of you out .
and i came to <unk> , <unk> .
and this is a project , where young people without a major in the ability to get , being artistic <unk> .
and that i really well done , and i was noted , art is something which i also a little <unk> .
by <unk> and the touch with <unk> was a filmmaker , on us .
he made the movie <unk> about the lives of my friends and myself .
and the film he won lots of .
we realized that the people to our history of interesting .
he was a very special feeling , because we 've never experienced , people to us , `` because we have .
and that 's such a moment , where i thought , okay .

i want something comes from my life make .
a collaborator of <unk> , a <unk> for refugees , for me on the idea for a <unk> of the <unk> <unk> to compete .
but since i 'm on my bold and buildings , totally enveloped me running , i ended up looking at a <unk> for a play and the title is <unk> one or four .
so i was right .
i was playing with .
and the cool thing is , after a performance alongside two editors , from <unk> publishing down to me as individuals .
and i had asked , if i 've had just dedicated <unk> to do .
i thought , great , <unk> .
you do 'official ' i do with .
and i made for this program <unk> , now , pulse <unk> and one of posts about a play <unk> , where i also ourselves <unk> was for the european <unk> on .
and i photographed him as well actually won .
now study i in college , for <unk> and the globe featured in munich <unk> 're in the third year , and i 'm <unk> the <unk> .
and this is for me not been possible if not one or organizations like <unk> or projects like <unk> well , for me to apply to have them .
they have to me believe they have to me a space is open , you made me through which is , and i found my place in society me <unk> can .
and we can get tired and i 'm going to them .
each of you have the way , people like to help second chance to get and their lives or her place in society to find .
because that people , in every day come by a hundred million refugees in munich , and each of you 're with hope and each of you have a huge potential .
they did it with great and determination to many terrible producer of behind them to make .
and with this determination , you could really big problem for germany will be , and for every one of us too .
and i could actually a little things that , what you can make , but because i had no longer enough time , although it says , a minute , 40s , i put them a <unk> me .

we scan it the code and then they come on the side of <unk> with many possibilities , what they have can do .
and that would take us all right to help .
i , me , ever known for their engagement and we look out , i hope .
and then scan it the code .
i ' there .
many have the phone , did not in his hand .
you are so nice , then , or what ?
okay .
thank you .
<unk> yes .
just a <unk> <unk> for me .
i 'm me that we know if we have .
my name is a robin chase .
my <unk> is write a simpler than it to speak .
i 'll get tired of austria , this is in vienna .
i 'm ' i still very , today in <unk> be pleased to , is really beautiful here .
i a me here every time , very comfortable .
and this is not just spouting cliche , this is a sense .
yes , yes , in contrast to the other <unk> i 'm not here today , you about anything to start telling .
i did n't know , what .
but it is that i text that moment in my hands and then in power to talk anas ' , mostly in <unk> <unk> or <unk> or just events like the world today .
yeah , and i was on , and asked , some text that textbooks , to the program a bit of bursts .
and that 'll figure '' and i 'm doing here .
yes .
i start with a joke .
, two million chickens .
and says that a so , two english , chickens and i of <unk> you up and <unk> so not <unk> , but <unk> ever been fun , i of <unk> you up and <unk> are <unk> <unk> in <unk> .
it tells the other yeah .
hey <unk> ca n't <unk> me .
here we have this level , organized .
the first text is a little <unk> that i just wrote `` gotcha .
i 've ever seen it was a person at that scare me , which means that has .
it carries the title <unk> .
and yes , they did it was in the same police did n't understand .
when your head in my lap , slept under your rest of my ceiling .
my leg , was also under my ceiling , your leg , the outside the ceiling .
my leg got long by the ceiling .

that has <unk> , as about my leg is extremely long .
it was very romantic .
the next couple of text , i whistled even then one person at that i 'm very much does .
and it 's my grandpa owned .
we 've ever since no contact with more .
my <unk> grandpa owned by all the butchers .
in a child has it with love making cut .
i 'm doing this right , yes .
yes , even 'n text .
better be the not .
jesus is the only the rescuers despaired , standing on the patient 's on the glass of the bus .
but what jesus was when he made me before that 's <unk> ' `` save them ?
we have to think , yeah ?
i mean <unk> been brought ?
range of text .
the next text is a little bit more .
he 's actually a .
so to write .
now to go faster .
's the beginning of a novel , of my degree in the <unk> write .
ah , it 's about <unk> guy , so the man from a guy , the , again and the hair somehow , and a little too much <unk> .
i <unk> ' me , but again and at this point entirely unconscious by the book i myself .

chapter one .
if i <unk> 's my head up empty .
this is abandoned like this piece of that he 's going to fill tried .
yes , and i 'm not be .
very hard half hours .
the next text is also a little <unk> .
most people do n't it .
i do 'official ' i 've gone too hard .
and it 's this is that , i play , like to my traditional vocabularies and with my language .
i 've got tired and ran to me the ground .
and yes , then get hold onto these things out .
it carries the title <unk> .

is probably the <unk> <unk> that i 've written gotcha .
<unk> we can .
yes , we can .
we all can .
we <unk> .
<unk> i ca n't .
but i can only .
i can flourish .
i can not .
yes , i do yourself also not understand .
no idea .
yes , and high-fives of me out .
i 'm tired of course , either of or no .
the next sheet , and what to get to do .
's kind of such a little <unk> .
i 've ever seen this time for the insects .
very polite .
yes , even 'n text .
is a little <unk> .

my writing is the title , all good things are really cool .
<unk> <unk> is <unk> so dry .
<unk> we all <unk> .
so we have to cuddle , <unk> , <unk> and actually , and then becomes the better and yes , that 's it .
beautiful it 's kind of the moment .
yes , even 'n <unk> , that 's having a different .
and it 's about it cool , and whenever i used to do 'official ' that we all that can kind <unk> could do , so 'n 's try that every time .
right , so that what the wind power , asdfasdf .
the text which carries the title <unk> and goes like this .
yes .
it makes fun with you .
the <unk> text is just a sentence .
i write like , so like this little <unk> .
this is a hidden increases pun .
that increases is to <unk> s .
<unk> s ?
yes , yes .
it makes fun with you .
yes , even 'n sentence .
this is in <unk> written .
is a very long sentence .

here , a text .
this day is a <unk> .
is the title of the text .
this day is a <unk> and he knows it .
he already know , before i it as such give up .
he had me and purpose of quickly become intrigued , then he would me <unk> let me .
i could do to me later , in him <unk> .
i was led him the joy .
it as <unk> of all other days unnatural demand and me back to get here .
with a <unk> <unk> on the face where else ?
and aim , it 's no longer to appreciate , so i <unk> .
and i was later , but back up , it can do n't talk about a crappy day we actually have .
gives hope , right ?
now it 's time for a joke .
what i said , and albert einstein , when he would be a steak medium does n't really liked ?
i is very much .
so .
the letter very sounds like the cow .
so that 's funny .
yes , the next text it has this paper , winter thing .
this is more what political .
so , i write 's not just fun things .
i write 's also partially destroys you are watching .
and it 's 'll figure '' i often wondered , where i <unk> .
and , yes , there was like , i 'm describing these text message here .
he carries the title <unk> .
my dad came from vienna , then in my mother and i 'm from her .
yes .
if we have the <unk> .
thanks for the sound .
yes , at this point , i would like , i love to a little plug do .
i have no business cards , or so these gaps , so i have this keeps <unk> do .
and it 's <unk> ' i also ourselves , and i make it myself a <unk> <unk> in vienna .
can look like to show up .
and yes , i <unk> ' , i <unk> 's actually very <unk> .
and , yes .
that would like , i just have said .
it goes on the program .
more targeted apps .
this is a little plug , and i just wrote `` gotcha .
feet .
rich with vitamin c .
so the <unk> .
vitamin a toe .
ever been very funny .
i do it 's a joke about the <unk> your girlfriend , say , but the punch it was just down .
yes , is not , my <unk> .
forward you have to stop the <unk> <unk> <unk> you have to how the <unk> of the ground ♫ it .
yes .
thanks for listening .
you were terrific .
thank you , ladies and gentlemen .
let me the same with a <unk> question to start .
why do you <unk> actually do ?
i mean , everybody , the tax money and then we should , whether it at some potentially of society , what could give you can .
the answer is very clearly .
we know now that the life expectancy for the point in the birth just to about <unk> percent of genetically <unk> is .
this does it must have any of environmental , <unk> give the impact on <unk> have .
why we know it still so little ?
why we 're all bombarded by <unk> messages from the <unk> that 's a part of each other -- disagree with ?

it was fat .
you thought , if you fat from the food , old-fashioned style , we 're all got sleek , and be healthy the old .
what the <unk> of <unk> <unk> shelves at various <unk> in the american grown to islamabad , and what do n't it 's changed that the americans every year before there are .
then you have said , ah , no .
but not the fat .
it 's the carbs .
what i come to <unk> like the <unk> the <unk> , the <unk> and so on has led .
so it 's over and can create new <unk> sow through a 's a village <unk> .
where the whole <unk> ?
now , the reason is , for my taste a part of at that we go through <unk> <unk> approaches anecdotal cases of the wisdom <unk> .
prime example of <unk> alone is here .
the <unk> you know of all .

the top <unk> the <unk> <unk> for this one year .
keith schacht , avis richards , seven years of on top on .
and then he died in the newspaper .
or this lady here .
jean <unk> .
the oldest individuals , the leak , depending on the earth has lived .
<unk> years old .
i know , there are some people , who say , they are six hundred , but on their <unk> n't find .
jean <unk> is actually <unk> jail .
and they listened to <unk> on to smoke started , but with <unk> again to then to end up with <unk> <unk> the path of the virtue of the consequences and stop to smoke .
with <unk> is then they died .
what is that ?
not that cigarettes , healthy tissues are .
but it tells us that , aging , very complicated , and that we got safer , we need to need to stop , experimental media systems and we need to ask questions .
can take a question , and a very simple issue , the in different countries , preserved , women are older than men .
what is that ?
we know it 's now .
this is the testosterone , the <unk> so , which in the male <unk> it will .
and there 's <unk> very clear evidence for <unk> men are just as old women .
you can now everybody for yourself think if that a <unk> <unk> is .
austria 's a <unk> country .
but there are even better than trade tips , not afraid .
general , should we hats of with <unk> to do .
sounds complicated , but it 's just kind of usual <unk> to illustrate .
there goes , so anybody can <unk> grandma , and asks , what it have so different way or another way that you that old have become ?
ah .
the granny 's every day , cigarettes .
this is probably the secret of their ages , right ?
and have the 10 of cigarettes , maybe just not the color .
or , but they have color and the granny say , without the 10 of cigarettes , even older cultures are .
and be hard statistics are not always potent .
there 's for example , can really hard , which shows that people that <unk> of tuscany , and visit the older , when people that does n't do this .
so sustainably harvested .

is that from the <unk> <unk> ?
no .
it 's because that the people just enough money in his pocket have to good for her age , and the <unk> diseases to take care .
if i but a group of <unk> a <unk> to feed to give and this group with 20 percent live longer than we can , from the <unk> just did n't got , but otherwise very same way that was then i was actually be a <unk> factor in the diet is affected .
and indeed are these attempts made .
must tell you , the <unk> is very <unk> -- but even i do with my enemies , agree , this is that regular ramadan , that life longevity .
and this works for the different organisms .
for example with bacteria .
you see here we can <unk> of bacteria .
when we ramadan , in the <unk> line showing you live in the significantly more .
the same applies to <unk> , <unk> flying over mice and recently was only about two years in the u.s. that it even for a monkey is on .
and what it 's not about , skinny .
it works in <unk> the fat the kitchen .
and that 's one another experiment , which in the united states was done .
what did you did here ?
they can <unk> fact , and has one of this so-called green <unk> l-dopa , a <unk> diet , where you so many <unk> this day and night that they got .
and who sort of quitting , the mice are becoming fat that had become sick and have can all comedians <unk> and a bad <unk> .
now , you can not parallel <unk> fact , and that 's the exactly the same amount of <unk> looking at the only that song can pause it was .
they are in n't eat the ledge , for you have to twice as much potatoes .
and these <unk> well , sleek , and healthy and they also has no <unk> .
when in both animals <unk> hand-raised chicks were .
both have to be eaten .
the a sick and the other healthy .
so what happens when you ?
it 's a process called cellular <unk> or <unk> clicked on .
whenever you , or nerve cells replicating food taken away then there 's the organism , obsolete , uncuttable constituents in the cell or to these ingredients to unfold them to figure out of energy to do .
that makes sense .
and it looks like .
you can see , like in the cell , to <unk> form , of crashed , the majority of middle-aged <unk> .
the <unk> then with the stomach and the ingredients are <unk> and the cell as energy back to draw the .
so , it just going on the age , accumulate into limits .
this is quite the molecular <unk> the <unk> , or the <unk> of the <unk> a report .
so , about it summary , regular ramadan is that live in all these organisms .
and it 's probably , just assume that 's also in people work .
and we learn from that they just did n't like in <unk> usda recommends that every little <unk> the day with 20 <unk> fight are .
no .
but , they 're supposed to say , if you 're hungry , ah , maybe it 'll just the <unk> clicked on .
welcome change your hunger , as a boyfriend .
and that 's also <unk> sense .
while <unk> point where nine , nine percent of human history has the human being what did , when he got hungry man had ?
right , he 's a hunting and left .
we go on the fridge , hunting , if we 're hungry , .
and this is the battle against the biology .
now we know , and that 's been in the bible , in <unk> chapter <unk> verse <unk> , the mind is readily , but the meat is weak .
the garden , for us very different from .
this sort of ariana <unk> in a medieval paradise being shown .

and that 's sort of the actual <unk> .

it could get to be interesting , whose <unk> not enough just <unk> <unk> <unk> .
and it could we might one of the hardest <unk> of life time .

and we have a hundred , to get immune scans , natural , immune .
we have in fact , a found that means <unk> .
<unk> is a wax-like substance that looked at all of organisms that 's this is the but also in all , during the aging , less will .
in your skin , it 's the <unk> .
<unk> people have been significantly less <unk> in your skin as <unk> .
and if we now <unk> on human cells are , for example , then you see what happened .
this is can is through your cells here .
is the <unk> , the nucleus , we give <unk> it , and we see many thousands of these little <unk> in the cell lines , the crashed , the majority of middle-aged <unk> , <unk> .
<unk> cells , exactly like this .
and this works in all these organisms .
here for example , shown on a <unk> .
so we can actually found the molecular <unk> lightbulb the <unk> .
life , because the organisms that even more .
and the answer is again , you see here we can be the <unk> of <unk> .
there are simple <unk> .
after <unk> days are all dead , after forty days is about half the dead .
whenever we <unk> the water to , here in very colorful , the animals grow and surviving better .
we also know that human cells that we by donors about an <unk> <unk> have in culture , about three times as long held together , if we want to <unk> know ?
and the latest research , we put too close that even the lives of all over mice down through <unk> longevity is .
and it 's not only that life , it 's also the <unk> .
these mice are significantly <unk> .
so .
there 's talk , of all know , where 's <unk> before ?
how the name it says , it 's the sperm coming out of being , there 's going to it very high .
but i can you up , even in <unk> fresh green and pepper mushrooms , cheese , and a product of <unk> soybeans , which in japan , big <unk> be sure , that happens to test <unk> 's very much <unk> ago .
we then i said , if <unk> against <unk> helps , putting it 's a bunch <unk> helps you might be able to <unk> ?
they have to see , you know that the common point of all <unk> favorites is that during the ages , <unk> in the brain <unk> .
and we have in fact , experiments that made about .
they 're going to wonder , we 've looked at the flies have done .

they have more <unk> in the brain , if you 're old will .
and the molecular mechanisms that for remembrance of these are very much like the people .
now you ask , yet , like the hell 's the guy called the memory of fruit flies the measure ?
this is the experiment , what we made up with -- stephen seals out of college in berlin who made .
you take a fruit and engaging in the one of giving them to smell , the they love .
<unk> .
and let the recursion in this <unk> ground .
then you take the same fly , give them in the next <unk> and give you <unk> different smell , the they love , <unk> .
and we make it the <unk> enjoy , while you can <unk> <unk> .
the classic <unk> .
then you take over the same fly , do these pure .
the driving this degree in the <unk> down , because it is .
and if you have here is arrived , you 'll give you off the one hand <unk> and of other hand <unk> to .
where do that everyone down ?
yeah .
the cherry factory .
except the two here .
this is the <unk> .
or , we say , they have a character .
i love my <unk> and i let 's not untie me through that can <unk> reward <unk> .
okay .
but it 's can form of a character , to the age increases .
not just to fly .
and we could actually the <unk> the fly through <unk> on a <unk> , on a <unk> , a level of them .
and the <unk> , the brain now we were , again , velocity .
that means <unk> does n't just for dealing with aging , but also to <unk> diseases , potentially .
and that 's important , because we want is the <unk> not the span of per se do .
it 's no point , the time the <unk> to do .
and i want you do n't go , without them , a few practical , tips to give us , we maybe some younger .
it to <unk> ramadan .
it 's not about that you lose weight , reduced , or so .
there are actually now in austria , can set of <unk> people , the one day he eats , and one day n't eat .
this is that green <unk> under the vocals , by bernard to and by erwin <unk> .
and that this is very good .
that is , it 's <unk> .
and avoid it <unk> .
it 's not about carbs , da , carbs , seem to actually not harmful to be .
it 's really trying to eat candy .
you know now that <unk> are going to have to get diabetes person , even then if you have are .
and you know , that sugar the growth of tumors -- accelerate can .
this is can <unk> , the sensitive to the ages .
after 30 days are all dead .
very low doses of glucose rich enough .
for a <unk> actually get cross-ventilation .
there 's just an example that works in almost all of organisms that .
and eat them on fruit and vegetables .
avoiding the gift of too much <unk> or of <unk> at all .
you know now that <unk> -- and <unk> cancer -- can .
this is not under conditions of vitamin d .
we are there might have degrees ' in winter , a <unk> , because vitamin d is driven by sunlight on the skin .
some that you look at least three times per week can half hour , sports , and we are trivial .
and cigarettes , despite the original <unk> examples of them <unk> 10 to fifteen years lifetime .
do you look at times of the eternal <unk> occasionally the rest begin .
the impact of them and blood pressure on the life expectancy is to back .
because the monks of lives almost as long , how women .
<unk> , <unk> <unk> , live longer than <unk> .
<unk> live longer than <unk> .
but <unk> are still more than <unk> .
just <unk> die , sooner than <unk> .
what is that ?
the people assume that 's what with any immune to do .
we , we , that 's very simple .
so here 's a <unk> the window is that 's plaster ' i could be with <unk> <unk> we can go away .
and what that 's probably in her , vascular migraines .
<unk> them , <unk> and so what , by drinking alcohol , under conditions there <unk> .
so , alcohol of all can <unk> effect .
a long-term partner , or you can family is about longevity , human .
they should n't a lot of the busiest streets you live .
now you think about to <unk> .
this , but with <unk> nothing to do .
it 's preserved from .
you can measure the more elaborate for any of a lot of the busiest streets lives , the more <unk> he 's the blood .
and it as well , if he says , i was , jesus , on the habit .
i can already fine to sleep and the sound does that i did n't mind .
's wrong .
he has been more <unk> in the blood and that 's bad .
there are supposed to go to be prosecuted <unk> of course .
we know now that <unk> very good metabolic effects that has .
one of it can see how did in space .
and we also know that onions and <unk> mice down to diseases , either .
that we knew by our grandmothers , and even the us with <unk> and so on <unk> have .
may not without any sense .
many studies show that dark chocolate , dementia <unk> , are we can .
just recently is a beautiful study , held high , who has shown that can half the board of dark chocolate , a day , the <unk> one <unk> on the level of <unk> can associate .
similar to get rid of coffee there 's the data at now thinner .
there are trials , the show , there is studies that it does n't show .
what 's clear , this is that coffee , diabetes <unk> , and their metabolic performance better .
and the coffee is actually also a good <unk> because he solves <unk> , like we made up with <unk> <unk> from paris able to show .
can very nice and intricate study in the hundred thousand people or 15 years of studies have to have shown that people that every day can of together to eat their <unk> about 20 percent mortality down .
this is an enormous value for you can <unk> study .
and that with almonds , gathering brazil , glued , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> .
but not to peanuts all the botanically seen in fact , beans are .
and give just to , putting them to peanuts together to call , okay ?
this is that , but actually , beans .
so to peanuts , so is not .
the next thing is a little <unk> .
avoiding the shot of a lot of animal protein , so of meat and dairy , but only , if you between <unk> and <unk> years old are .
can very beautiful new research shows that you , if you in this time , too much , animal protein to take you <unk> so much more medication , as if you an enormous smokers , be .
this is not for the time afterwards , where the animal protein , well , and it is true for granted , not to walk children or teenage years , the animal protein , and it 's not for pregnant and the ones that it will want .
generally , do you <unk> .
and they do , we keep it 's silky , that i knew already , friedrich nietzsche that has said the objection that <unk> that <unk> disbelief , the <unk> are signs of health .

this is the gentleman <unk> <unk> who has about after that regime , and he 's <unk> years old .
it comes from my home <unk> from the <unk> , is never get sick .
and it 's very good .
he 's just did n't <unk> alone , not an anecdote , but he lives in a <unk> , where it was a lot of healthy <unk> are .
it 's about the <unk> followed that i think you today i 've said .
we should look at all the <unk> experiments , can important fact , not passed .
which is that <unk> of aging me receives an organic , but a social seems to be , and so after a <unk> .
you <unk> the old man 's going to and it could get one of the <unk> wrong with our culture .
<unk> wrote the great novel at the <unk> a year before his death .
the brothers .
a piece , with judging critics of the adolescent , fresh <unk> .
thank you for your attention .
i want to start with a question that i think you do .
a question , where do n't get up to , because that 's a bit of avalokitesvara , because of you who 's kinda lonely process ?
the output is what if you very low .
there 's more than i thought .
it , but probably the reasons , why they 're not reported that we 've also the people that to actually quite <unk> would .
many people do solitude and loneliness and think that would <unk> .
it 's not liking that the case .
you 'll see , and loneliness is actually more like a phenomenon , among humans than just straightforward .
maybe lies it also that they 're not reported , because the question is blurry . sentiment that is .
you feel you just kinda lonely , or , you are lonely process ?
you can be lonely , feel , without feeling lonely .
and you can be lonely be without looking at the moment lonely having to feel .
one 's too much to shame , to do .
and that 's some now here has prevented , to loneliness to <unk> .
one thing is going to shame and the shame here goes into one .
one takes time .
that as going to us right now , nobody who have in the few seconds , which i do you 've given .
one needs <unk> .
one needs the time , to their own , even aware enough to be .
and loneliness need also practice , to talk about to do .
and this exercise have that we put themselves not .
we have neither the language , we have any sign for ourselves to recognize when we are lonely process ?
there 's the one of two <unk> , i 've ever again and you 're running around .
the one part of man says , you is from beginning of lonely .
from birth to death is you just really lonely .
it 's a few moments in life where you that <unk> can .
these people go and often to <unk> and bypassing , the whole day off .
i 've ever seen no time , is so you <unk> .
and then there are people might be a lot in that say , everything is with everything connected .
that i think there are n't actually , so , i just a piece of big universe .
and there 's the great group , to the i also am the time , so , just so imagine .
the thinking , okay , today i am feeling lonely and the next day , oh , it 's sort everything together .
if we of loneliness to think we always begin with the very big one of a one .
the one of dying , the one of the sick in an icu .
but about this <unk> , about these big <unk> <unk> ' i listened to do n't talk , but i want to talk about the small , over the everyday <unk> , where it’s loneliness to happen in such a theater , you can .
i would also not talking about the burden , and <unk> of <unk> .
it’s loneliness to another one-by-one we usually did n't suffer from loneliness to us to discover <unk> already .
the photographer and christine , tailors , in the break a few pictures made that i show you want .
how easy it 's always keeps falling , in other one disease .
and we all know , not , whether these people are in this moment lonely , have felt .
but who knows it’s not , the moment in such <unk> event , where you think , we 're all together , just you go on this is something lost in the corner and has anybody to <unk> .
and suddenly <unk> loneliness to know the safe here all .
may have some of you today , and even teach .
what you to do you ascend up the phone started out how many times , and that could you today , you 're seeing is that playing , that <unk> on the phone , as an escape the brink of solitude .
and visible , if you on the screen -- look .
what we now here 's not do .
yeah , and then there is the one , the types of them is the one of <unk> on <unk> stage , hundreds of <unk> faces of a hundred and even something out in hopes that you are the text , not forget .
this is the <unk> that you the outside it looks .
we are educating people on .
but i 'm sure , there are also people in the room , the way out of birth to her feel the her whole life , so he spent , if you have tried , this one of course , <unk> , to distract them .
and there are in this room can guarantee you people who are lonely , because it on a different people have been to be there because of death or because of a separation .
because it also not something that 's so many people , as humans , with whom they 're connected , around you are they are feeling lonely .
and there are people that have the regard to himself will find no contact to stop , and are so , one lonely .
i <unk> ' that the digital loneliness .
and sit , you in the analog to one .
the analog to one is we can be familiar .
this is that people who have to her what i think there 's about social and contacts .
and that 's always had relative .
it 's no public figure , n't have any number , when someone is that 's human contact , when i do n't .
we thought there in the older people a .
it 's an analog form of loneliness .
since we but everybody in cities of living connection with a lot of people at facebook or at twitter or facebook is this digital to one of getting bigger .
you can begin with hundreds of people to be connected , without using a single person 's really connected to be .
it 's the analog to one of the product of human relationships , the missing is it at the digital surveyed the quality of relationships .
the two forms of loneliness that are many other <unk> .
this is also that the analog to one of a little mold poke them .
whereas the digital loneliness to be good works for <unk> and plays in <unk> .
it 's kind of date , that the digital loneliness to the future more weight , if the possibilities , to connect , get bigger .
i do n't know , if you in 20 years that feeling that the benefit from loneliness . pretty will be , more loneliness to call it will .
or whether you for and then a new conception , you .
but that are also kind of the problems with the <unk> generation .
almost to get bigger than the one of self is the very afraid of loneliness and from this very afraid of loneliness that are people gained some of doing so ready .
<unk> , the big <unk> , as a <unk> person has a wonderful <unk> written <unk> .
in which describes her , what people do everything , not alone .
they build cathedrals , they account for children , and then again , lonely , and alone .

and shop to go .
things that carbon credits .
both the event you get on the one , because it at least have a touch them as the objects themselves , and acquisition , .
only problem is that it 's very briefly , help and stops , this sort of those potions for the one .
so we need again and new things to buy us new <unk> .
i 've ever seen at that advertisements for a a <unk> panties label it .
and the <unk> a very , <unk> of your communications , to the tagline of be a lot of it .
what that in my panties , to do that , you know you do n't , but apparently you can also that .
one has so nothing to solitude and to do one finds the people like that happens .
<unk> <unk> has a wonderful poem written , and there is a verse , but the worst is the one of the second .
hand on a 's heart , who knows that 's not ?
in a relationship to wake up or the or the other the brushing her to see and to all of a terrible thing only to feel , awful , lonely having to feel and the question to imagine , who is this guy really ?
i said , ' i started to actually something to do ?
a survey said to the most lonely and women around the coming out , married , with kids , feel .
see is missing , because i now , you do n't know , i be the study , even invented , so often , ' i they told .

that 's so completely obvious thing is , almost as a <unk> .
one of the second is any <unk> and yet we speak not about you .
speaking like that little bit about the one of the sex .
and that 's probably already all experienced .
even when you <unk> is to all of thinking , what do 'official ' i really ?
who is this person in my bed , really ?
and that a form of loneliness that does n't exactly what to have to the quality of <unk> the way .
it 's nothing to do have to the quality of relationship .
it 's just always there .
we speak only do n't about them , because we 're not monsters .
we speak only one really not about them in the workforce .
in the workforce is the one of the <unk> than we think .


and there was something <unk> , something <unk> with the <unk> in his hand of our own intern .
i believe that , i have you the scene , did not going to do so you that form of loneliness that everybody 's gone as time in his career that has to <unk> can .
it 's the one of <unk> .
but it 's also the one of <unk> .
we all know the <unk> or i see , sit here might be a couple of the her life make to <unk> .
in <unk> , in <unk> into hotels , in a generic bars and often do n't know more , who they actually are , what they do .
where they are , where you wake up .
and that 's a form of loneliness , over the not talking about this is .
just so it 's also <unk> , like it’s loneliness than <unk> be abused , .
on here is this typical skyscraper .
i have a <unk> told that he called was a client , and who has said , it 's what a horrific happens , you can it does n't imagine .
a <unk> was alone in the lunchroom .
so , he himself to <unk> applies to .
and two months later , he 's also kind .
and loneliness is not alone so .
it 's always want to other feelings .
it 's beautiful siblings and she 's ugly , sibling .
the ugly siblings , we all .
fear , with grief and despair , anger and the shame .
but we should also the siblings , not forget .
the freedom to the proud of the desire that <unk> .
so i 've spoken by looking at a loneliness to .
and come and goes in life as a tidal marsh , and tides .
let them to and let 's not from their kind of us .
because there 's something much worse than the loneliness and this is the emptiness that maybe for the one comes when you do n't need to feel .
it’s loneliness is part of life .
since i so hard about one after i 've got to me two things change .
one in my friends who the <unk> i do n't like the rulers in the dictator , since i realized , that i only then always somebody type 1 : why he does n't raise your because i thought , perhaps my grip , i the people , maybe i 'm ' i lonely .
i it 's having been , since i the one in my life is yours , people come and go to make .
that 's exactly the acquaintances , and found that power .
and there i am and free .
people come and go to make , they do n't immediately to the planet , though , from an encounter a friendship , or even a partnership between us could .
as a kid , i found my parents were incredibly accurate .
the ability to operate <unk> go by having with somebody a conversation with anybody .
whether in the <unk> or in the economy .
every time , it to row conversations .
as a kid , i found that as i 'm embarrassed .
as young adult , i was it 's incredible for <unk> that to get this openness to have .
but since i even so with the one member , i do you get me at least , and again , i also direct acquaintances , so to open .
you see it 's kinda lonely , his name is ready to do for the next artistic performance .
thank you .
yes , thank you .
i 've ever seen here , these bills in .
a <unk> a <unk> and a <unk> .
and now it 's ' i do you if you just once it probably what reality would you do ?
the most going to <unk> decide .
and that 's a damn good idea .
and why ?
because we better at least of freedom of the most profound effect of revenue .
in health , we doing this kind of different .
so let 's the activity with the most profound effect disappears completely other than eight and choose to us , for some strategies .
we 're forced us for example of <unk> and the stands for sports .
big <unk> but huge effort .
for me that 's not so valuable .
or we 're forced us to <unk> .
this is for diet .
also very large <unk> but still very big effort .
for me that 's also not so valuable .
and i want to try to tell you can better at least of freedom of the biggest <unk> are .
if you to prevention and health , concerned , you about a theme of ai n't guys .
and this topic is overweight .
and this topic either overweight , was in germany , long time , not an issue , i was about to the <unk> .
and then went into the number of obese people in germany , a very quickly .
and i was asked me , which was there on in the <unk> ?
why did this soaring all up ?
and i figured research and i 'm also <unk> jail .
because it has exactly the year <unk> .
what was there ?
there was <unk> to germany .
and we 're over and getting bigger ?
and i was going out .
<unk> comes for to germany .
and increased growth .

and what 's going to germany ?
<unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> , and how it means .
and we 're over and getting bigger ?
well , i figured , one , and one <unk> .
because it has been clear .
sports is thick .
and of <unk> ' i 'm not here today , for me to say that a sports , dick 's doing .
because that 's not .
but one , we have now , together , it .
the tide of the new and training -- and <unk> did n't know , to islamabad , that we 're looking and healthier we 're going .
what it 's so then ?
the diet ?
and there 's can be a wonderful study from the united states .
and they have the problem with obesity .
and they have to <unk> <unk> system .
and then they wanted to shortly after a look , so what happens when you ?
and they 've seen that people are actually becoming less fat on but people are also getting fewer calories to be , but still getting ever seen before .
and that 's paradox .
and so you do it <unk> called .
we can explain that ?
there are you look at the body as a power to imagine .
because we have here that can big <unk> .
and on the one side of it 's a <unk> , because i do we all the swallow it , who are here is incinerated .
and this is the courthouse to power .
if we now , to swallow this in to give in our power than we on the other hand , <unk> to the energy in the power and it makes you slam them .
the human body does n't buy a slam them .
the can get the energy protein .
and it 's in fat .
our biggest dreams , and <unk> <unk> .
what happens , but if we are fewer such as we 've heard , energy <unk> and yet <unk> here is the energy and then makes it 's a conclusion to .
the <unk> has become significantly lower .
here is actually ca n't live longer than it .
we 're not just a mobile .
and that 's happening .
our grandparents are <unk> yet 20 kilometers to take a fluke .
and we get these types of , one to two miles and there are these same estimates .
there are trials , the reports of five -- until <unk> meters .
i <unk> ' you that 's a <unk> with my friend mike , telling .
you giving me degrees ' the chair ?
mike , you come degrees ' time ?
mike 's an american .
he 's really shy , he 's not talking too much .
and he was back at this trial and sitting now here .

and mike eat less and and increasingly , and eats only still <unk> , and yet he 's over and before .
why ?
because mike 's sitting .
and i was a set out , how much exercise mike gets so the day , and i got to him times as a step counter the back in the bag and maths and the night i 'll get back <unk> .
and there stood on a thousand steps .
it was so the distance that mike , here 's wake up in the kitchen to the car with the car in the office there , of a little bit of coffee , over and in the back .
and he came up a thousand steps .
that means that mike , on this day 10 minutes on its legs .
<unk> hours and fifty or was mike , or was mike .
amongst those conditions that creates disease by itself .
and mike 's not so being dick , because he too much eating and so long as it up again and energy <unk> this , but not up and then he will inevitably must always getting bigger and the energy <unk> to .
and the first <unk> to the energy , you can see here on his <unk> .
but energy is <unk> that 's not there .
the <unk> , eventually came back into <unk> blood .
and there is they 're underactive and <unk> still , and quiet in his <unk> .
so the sugar .
so if , the energy <unk> the blood , then talk about the physicians of high blood sugar and high <unk> .
and that sugar , the <unk> there as with cavities , makes all little black holes in this <unk> .
and a happiness goes there 's the fat of , and that you basically just about these little nasty wounds and we talk about <unk> or atherosclerosis .
and this is going <unk> heart right under pressure , because now it needs to the blood flowed through those circles , <unk> jars , pumps and we talk about blood pressure .
and if the blood and then in such a <unk> hits , then makes it also in the body , 'pow !
and if that the heart is , then we call the heart .
and if that in our happens then we call the stroke .
and also in germany and dies every second of ischemic heart and the stroke .
that go in germany and dies every second to <unk> .
and mike gets so not so sick , because he did not exercising , but because he was n't even more than moving .
and if you this context or not know , then , you always on the wrong place .
for example , in a diet .
i have degrees ' generation to diet in the amazon went back and get there for example <unk> <unk> <unk> , old .
and if each book that 's a centimeter is thick and we 'd like this one <unk> , if we have a 30 feet high tower , the current <unk> <unk> .
and i was the time for you read all .
and it says , in and now that 's really important if you more energy in so more food as they use , then you will be thick .
and if you less energy in when they use , then you will be thin .
that 's brilliant .
but why we need for example , where you ?
it 's just a conclusion to .
this desire is , of floors , but <unk> is to do n't help .
because why then a diet of a hundred percent ?
because it 's a diet , and not a lifestyle .
what they 're using the things that we here to three weeks , and here to five weeks ago when we asked afterwards , after this struggle , again in the normal life back , to our ordinary lifestyle .
what are then actually , after five or seven weeks ago ?
nothing .
but they got back and a <unk> in the confidence that we do n't that made , what we 've done have .
so you allowed to go from here today is present new diet , is present new <unk> ask you can you want that in their day-to-day , in your lifestyle community .
yes or no ?

and if not so let it just stay .
because if the end of anything out , is it 's just for time .
it 's the habits that you decide whether we 're sick , or stay healthy .
there are the bad habits that 's ill to do .
and it 's the good habits , the us healthy , we do .
and mike , in the mirror , if , then it does n't have the result of our lifestyle .
if mike , in the mirror , we look , then it does n't have to break habits .
and mike , in the mirror , if , and to be honest , is , then it does it 's , where he which is .
because when he more bad habits , as good , then it 's just looked into the sickness of the way .
and mike , in the curve is headed toward health , moving its goals , moving its dreams , then it needs to do n't immediately be whole life change .
then he need to just over a bad habits , as bad .
and a , and talking thinking and mike 's also a great example of that the human being a weird animal is .
mike , it for example , well , moving out completely his life <unk> by looking at any way to cradle car , we see each and it uses , everyone to lift the use .
and night , he was crying on the couches and to somehow <unk> again to grow up to come .
so is he was in his <unk> goes into your gym where the and it up , which is per se . it 's ironic is , and then becomes like that can got back in such a band <unk> , so he somehow , again to wave comes .
and my grandpa did , that the way as you .
who was a farmer and the would n't that we ?
who would have said , sport is for people who does n't move .
and somehow he 's also true .

environmental laws of this is we have today about this <unk> lifestyle , two hours of sports and make a day .
and about tase me much easier to the movement , there to find where we do you have lost .
the ground .
and so <unk> ' i do you today to a perspective , like .
maybe even know , they also the situation , you drive in a quick to the shopping and really , it turns into the front no place , free is .
and this is you see how difficult to get computers , this <unk> to that is .
we want to be the shortest i did it go .
we plan our homes and so that we <unk> have a way .
we 're all of our lives that we the <unk> have a way , but that brings us , but not , where we <unk> .
but in a very different direction .
so you allowed us from now the <unk> activate and the movement , which is where , where you , signs .
i use , like to participate in the trajectory .
and i 'm the only , who always waking up and down and up and down there 's now , and everybody else to stand .
but if i mean , ever since i 'm going <unk> ' i believe in the time for me .
then <unk> ' i believe in the movement , an acid , and that just sort of , lies .
and if from above the <unk> , 30 minutes repository , let’s just . '' i hooray .
for example steps .
that 's about three times 10 minutes . it means .

this may be relatively little sound .
but when <unk> , as a habit established , even <unk> days in fact , then we talk about four point five of fat .
so we 're not in our bodies have .
and you give me degrees ' time that , i <unk> '' it always <unk> .
the americans are like crazy , who do something so here .
this is a <unk> of five pounds of fat .
are made ' i four pounds .
so that you ever sees , what happened there with those baby steps .
and if that the effect is about this perspective , what you mean , what it happens , if you really in an active life to start .
and these <unk> to get them to take off to every day in your life .
once you look at <unk> steps per day he arrived , you walk you virtually every <unk> of them .
and if you be fed and i have time in sports and then do it on top .
you should have to the <unk> also <unk> .
then they will be even faster and stronger .
but do with your health , no longer dine on the amount of sports .
do with your health , no longer depending on how they feel and the time .
because the most the most important that they doing now , every day when your lifestyle .
and i <unk> 's an active lifestyle <unk> .
and to me is it has gotten more than a lifestyle , for me , it 's a lives it in the conscious decision is grounded in the lives and for me redefine itself .
because i think , health has not to do with , what we should do n't do have .
but health has to do with , what we want to do .
and so <unk> ' i now only one idea for them .
you decide to turn to just one of the best .
and down now you can also how it 's about .
step by .
thank you .
<unk> how did it sort of leonardo da vinci , actually done in such unbelievable , the vastness of ways , the world with others ' eyes to see ?
and ask yourself as much like on the vulnerable , what to his time , just simply inconceivable , inconceivable , was ?
we would like today anyway ?
that maybe what about companies to do ?
and how we can turn into force and confidence to our future , here ?
so , but once there with the question what do we actually pull out of innovation ?
yeah .
technology , innovation fund research and development , even the official <unk> the federal government has the title <unk> the government .
so they get me , right .
this is all great .
and we can with quite proud to be , and be grateful that we <unk> , in such a lot of the fields are that our technologies around the world is needed to be there 's fine with it 's about .
that we do with a bit startling fact , unique new wealth 've developed .
but what about the future from ?
the challenges , because when society to come ?
and who care because there to the huge ecological and social engineering challenges ?
so <unk> '' it seems to sort of investment to be .
a kind of the greatness .
so the care about the environmental challenges , because the entrepreneurs that big effort to you boost productivity and efficiency up .
and the world better do n't want to find in a nonprofit organization and together and citizens ' and who are going to be what do so basically all government of course , then to the damage the inner capitalist 's economy to deal .
at <unk> to fix .
but who says , because that we all this as something separated at need ?
how about it because if we <unk> to can apply social and cultural to expand ?
if technological innovation at the cultural innovation are ?
if the economic innovation at the social innovation are ?
if we were capable their thinking and doing to self-assemble in the solution big benefits , and social engineering challenges ?
if it very different type of forces <unk> and if we were capable a very different , and fair <unk> look forward ?
because it was that ?
both ways to have , but what companies , right ?
can do it ?
you ask , maybe the occasion .
so we do this is always as a way .
to happiness is it provides heartening examples .
muhammad yunus , with his <unk> , with his <unk> in bangladesh is incredibly powerful than the poverty , there <unk> .
and interestingly , too much more now in direct <unk> to what the government <unk> done have .
and he has <unk> as entrepreneurs , which has been noted for the nobel prize <unk> get .
the opportunity because we made me a i <unk> ' they still with anyone familiar to do .
brief , i must imagine andré <unk> .
'n quite subtle of young guy .
it 's trained , , but also their ideals africa .
and yes , so totally <unk> .
i love the kind of yours .
and if you to see , then you think there 's really where a young , because we need to us to our future n't worry .

this is he also very good .
that they like him , totally and there 's also very successful .
and yet , something is there 's so in him .
so he says , there 's not even more , the way to me is ?
so that this entrepreneurial enterprises , he says that whatever .
companies are like to <unk> .
and that they like him too .
and he had fallen as these <unk> .
so the right there 's the <unk> , the he is going to do .
so not that he asked him , if you know , but this from <unk> says it 's been what .
and the in the center at the t , three n , i knew he did n't .
so even more , it was surprised when the him , then the <unk> personally was introduced .
as mr. <unk> .
and when 'n veteran who , he then there are introduced .
the hopkin 's great pleasure face , so with young people , and his his experience to share .
and the two , then plummeted each country .
and i 've always be more choices .
how about it because if we just to in one of those conversations from the two times <unk> ?
yes ! mister <unk> , so what was that because again , right .
what 's exactly the difference between <unk> between <unk> <unk> and <unk> established business ?
that i did n't yet , that we ?
yes , so , andré then let 's what you look at the question , which is 'n <unk> company ?
so the name says it , yes .
were markets , is beginning of products , beginning to customers , is beginning of structure , there 's a history .

and time you can can <unk> , even when the very nice , is it can also go down .
what 's because then actually a <unk> ?
so , andré , you knowing been so one is it does n't guarantee it 's just not the small copy of a big company .
it 's something very different .
it has been a radically different character .
because it has to do n't <unk> .
not an established business , no <unk> <unk> , nothing is known .

and you 're going to ensure that it , in this <unk> organization , very very different kind of thinking , very different <unk> , very different ways .
yeah , it 's what i 've been clear .
but after what we look because essentially ?
so , i jump 'em . ' time , then you are taken there ai n't tell by <unk> <unk> to make money right ?
so i 've ever since the degree , that fits quite well , so 'n seminar i found in berlin , you want to me that would recommend it ?
this is <unk> .
how you keep your businesses , it <unk> and after the <unk> your life , <unk> did .
oh no .
really <unk> ?
what do you because if you want to start -- 30 your <unk> money did what 's because we keep your <unk> ?

what if you with your commitment , as i know you ?
and he 's look at times the <unk> on .

money is always the result of a successful company , and one good at the community-led enterprise .
now , you money is an energy to engage <unk> .

but it 's never the goal of a company .
yes , which is then the goal ?
of the company ?
so , when i know what do 'official ' i 've ever seen yet we learned , so without the goal is no way the right .
and so , and aims you 'd still have a measurable in time certainly be , and so forth .
and when i got it 's not got tired , so that as i can make a look from what i did n't know what i look for me to do ?
so i do n't feel good .
so how do i because the decisions , and risk of this is for me all so i think , and the uncertain .
yes , andré welcome to the enterprise .
but i 've ever since then maybe what for you .
one thread .
so this is yes , <unk> , so much as secret .

a <unk> for were in .
so , or how to tell you today ?
<unk> believe that ' i , <unk> ?
so we tell you know , and <unk> to .

so for it is guaranteed .
i believe that 's him , i can you one of us .
okay .
yes , thanks , mister <unk> .
but there are not just ask it .
that can see the same time you know it 's one of the important to engage qualities , is good escapes from asking questions .
that we can a bathroom since then the other to go through that i said that perhaps better understand ?
so the first is what i am here and what i want these gals ?
yes , andré , there 's <unk> what 's moving along the about you take that 's bigger than you are ?
what <unk> you in the world ?
what have the people of them , if you with you work ?
what you 're willing to be ?
what are your inner , maybe as well unconscious <unk> ?
why is that important that to see it ?
because that are also have an enterprise <unk> .
and how we do this of learned ?
if you a ship to build . will then <unk> not the men together bits of a name it on wood to collect , but i teach them , `` wish to scale scaling , the atrocities , the ocean .
yes , well .
so then i look , i let me the next questions for .
what 's my <unk> <unk> ?
what does that ?
yes , andré the right now think you can feed your goal really ever conceived .

you know , the story with pink and elephants ?
when he was kind of a .
not ?
square .
so , pass a brief rundown on .
reset your time , not a pink and elephants .
okay ?
well , it ?
so , not a pink and elephants .
understand ?
not a pink and elephants .
you see ?
so what it 's us , if we were so happy to focus on this , what we do n't want .
what is there in the only way ?
because it <unk> ?
yes , yeah , singing , you 're going on , what you want .
so <unk> <unk> or maybe the pandas on the <unk> .
but i 'm singing , you about .
incidentally , what i just could you want you , but <unk> right ?
i 've ever stop there to me .
i look time , if you the <unk> .

who that ?
at <unk> <unk> <unk> this <unk> what <unk> <unk> to death with a , <unk> <unk> .
i of <unk> <unk> of you up to <unk> me your <unk> at <unk> the time replacing the one <unk> <unk> mise en masse .
i of <unk> the glass in the master <unk> .
i of what <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> , sir .
and i of what <unk> my <unk> in the <unk> <unk> .
<unk> <unk> lady named tilly smith .

madam , as <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> you one <unk> adversity do <unk> <unk> may is the ground .
<unk> ago slip-slidin .
it 's <unk> the a matter of <unk> .

and andré what about that ?
is yours , which noticed ?
is something changed ?
okay .
okay , and the flower is too .
okay .
so , and then you look at times , then , let 's where the bear rainforest is .
and action .

who that ?
at <unk> <unk> <unk> this <unk> what <unk> <unk> to death with a , <unk> <unk> .
i of <unk> <unk> of you up to <unk> me your <unk> at <unk> the time replacing the one <unk> mise en masse .
i of <unk> the glass in the master <unk> .
i of what <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> , sir .
and i of what <unk> my <unk> in the <unk> <unk> .
<unk> <unk> lady named tilly smith .
and andré the way that are you that ?
so , i remember , i was also be shocked .
i was really shocked .
when i have the first time , in .
i thought it ca : yes , did n't be .
and more shocking , i was like me through the head of the rest is it might be that i actually the sort of the way through the area over ?
through my life .
and okay , i do n't do this is totally certain sense .
it to pick up there the immediate melt lead to prevent that we the most of our perception and our <unk> first <unk> need .
but what 's because now supposed to ?
what to jump , i was and what <unk> ' i 'm from ?
and therefore andré , with me to your perception to target somewhere <unk> to do is that we can other major more numerical quality .
well , yes , thanks , then we get some sort of the next question .
how could i 'm supposed to my goal come ?
so , i find that can make good question .
it 's ' i think is every time as well , and i know that somehow not going forward .
yes , andré , there is what we can good news for you .
this will see it easier to fall when you may have n't know that did .
because if you your hair is clear , your inner drive , and if you 'n , in the goal really sort of them nik 's i promise you , is it inside happen by .
almost as a machine .
you 'll do n't really differently , as being a brainstorming , in your brain is that stuff on a ship it .
this is that then these famous <unk> that you wake up underneath the shower , did .
and yet can ask , i did you to the spot watch a good about , who you engage you could who you to take an interesting questions could talk about this way to input , to look at home to get .
and you 've also a huge role .
the <unk> have that is , and brings .
duke di <unk> , if the no longer going to know , has the decade of the palazzo vecchio , to join in florence .
for lunch at the famous by the table .
and it 's totally different people .
so scientists , <unk> , politicians , the bankers , who were engineers , architects and he can really intense <unk> fostered .
but not in our present and so , where it ai went , yes , who 's catching on ?
who 's right ?
but rather , and that all of these different <unk> things , are the way to none of ways , one of them alone could have to that can .
well , yes , the next question is what good concrete next step i do ?
andré there are going to get on the successful entrepreneur in the reason to be simple .
instead of the size of planning and management and so on to focus , and just in the next step .
because what you going to because the domain of uncertainty while you do ?
but the run this really determined and with all the consequence out .
and if we then nothing was well , dan do you look to stop <unk> different step .
and even when the big , colorful <unk> <unk> nothing was then it 's not know , i can other .
so it 's so important that you your what 's clear .
it 's yours at the national security .
and the way , how we actually have all have learned ?
although we know that was n't know , and it 's nobody has said ?
to tell you also the number of the children .
so , this sort of learning , this stuff and this <unk> of searching it 's also , that was fun things that 's going to a company is happening in a <unk> .

yes , thank mister <unk> .
so that , yes , a great .
but i 'm not so , with me in the company , i believe that 's there must be a lot of change that there anything happens .
and myself , here in germany , there 's always been so that your mood .
and i believe that 's him , there have the politicians to put them to worry that to change .
okay my boy , come with .
how do this time , down to the water .
what do you , how many people can you change ?
10 ?
10 thousand ?
ten million ?
look at this down .
and you see ?
right , the .
this is the you change can , the you really change can .
or about it by mahatma gandhi to say , looking at the change that you in the world , looking at your own .
do you might be beautiful words and huge role models , but how to that virtually all work ?
because we have to happiness , 'n few <unk> on our <unk> .
helpful in all sorts of <unk> of crisis , or if you do too small , you feel for something or if you a collapsing feel and they 're all with you to do .
and if you fall in these situations , probably wondering what i 'm up now despite all of it 's ' along the kind of you take you can physically for you very powerful to feel .
it 's like , you , but the time , what you to them like , over the you just <unk> .
and very end up , it 's ' walk , what you actually sort of this crisis , or the , what happened is because i did .
so i mean , if you doing already happening is that comes to tase you off , .
yeah well .
nelson <unk> thank you .
and do you really that i think this is on my engage the way ?
yes , right .
and i 'd make some of two things .
first time , about on the clarity of your inner <unk> that it was trying to your enterprise , what will .
because it determines your perception .
and for the eighth place on your inner attitude to themselves .
because it <unk> you like the other people , to you do .
the future , the only appeased when we our own perception .
<unk> you that correspond ?
yes , i think ever been .
thank mister <unk> well then .
all good andré <unk> .
yes .
what you think about our andré ?
nice .
really , or , <unk> ?
and how we hold it because now actually , with that <unk> ?
it 's a new <unk> ?
i mean , yes .
very clearly .
what i of the spirit can see .

and this is , what the <unk> really thriving .
a <unk> from some potions for the euphoria .
and no , so new <unk> , square .
now this is the <unk> .
the right now in our long been in the big , famous name <unk> .
by robert but also about <unk> <unk> <unk> zeppelin -- or <unk> or how they all afternoon .
let 's quite simple answer those minds to re-set up .
and you know , maybe is yes , from our andré the next leonardo in our time .
they 're right , i 'm <unk> .
maybe it would be so <unk> that i made up with kids and their future study after all these are usually children , our future .
instead is that the view of my students of the time i enjoy .
i spend a lot of my life in prison .
four years ago , my father and i the program <unk> , entrepreneurship , for prisoners , forming .

why i 'm so , misinformation about <unk> , so they 've failed to on the big mistake i 've done ?
our program is a much not so easy to understand how things for the to care for children .
and be honest , i would have thought that the <unk> the last place in the universe is , where i work would .
what you think that 's the most of a factor in the kid with the people with that we work ?
we 've learned , there are positive models given that male , positive models .
and if you think about , why it in certain <unk> so many <unk> and so many <unk> are often lies in this thing that the father , no sensible work has it to drink that he 's the drugs , consumes one or that he asked ourselves in prison is .

and he <unk> his father to .
i <unk> ' you , martin , imagine .
martin 's <unk> our programmers .
his father was an alcoholic drink and made the whole family that live in the hell .
when he was 12 , is his mother died , and he and be a little baby brother who had to the home .
and it was the <unk> the great .
he was shy , and <unk> and the perfect person .
to the day to be a little baby brother and to a game , so roughly <unk> was that the floor would drop 40 .
there , transformers , martin examines the first time the <unk> through , he went on the enemy , and proposed to .
and down , that day he was respect .
and so it went off .
violence was from now to his life , just as with his father .
what 's going to catch that i just described just know , next ?
after the kid , after the youth who are lots of unemployed or have <unk> .
you 're not much more than your illegal activities and their <unk> over .
and then they will one day with people into prison is closed organizations that it 's go , their thoughts about the same thing around the also not a better models are .
about what , you think , consider these people along after , if you in prison , which are ?
typically about a good .
and they 're better to criminal justice in <unk> .

and that leads to then in germany to <unk> of <unk> percent .
that go in germany will all her , by criminals prison .
then there is , but also people in prison , who are changing want .
but also knew them wear a label on the trigger .
and it said <unk> .
and everywhere , where they come , is that your first building identity .
if you know , a desktop for , if you know , an apartment for whether they found a private build a relationship to wherever you 're looking at this identity , with the label that the you one , in the society that infinite , hard power .
this is the problem , to testify before we are .
how we try that problem of doing ?
the quality , you think , bringing lots of <unk> with ?
they 'll be surprised .
there are much better skills .
if you get a <unk> that 's built , definitely no idea of <unk> , of <unk> and of <unk> .
the only the theme in climate has a 's a little <unk> , else about '' he 's not in prison landed .
these characteristics we want to something positive use .
we start our program with a <unk> education in prison , in three blocks .
we teach the basics of entrepreneurship and the economy .
most people write its own business and anybody takes on a wide <unk> part .

so that was founding of go there from our agenda forward ?
it 's a wide range , from <unk> to the agency for <unk> .
we have a <unk> and <unk> .
a range , and <unk> ' i just like to naíma imagine .
<unk> their talent and its way , the ship and money , it 's been very early to trade with the cocaine seduced .
he had been fun thing , business to run .
he 's then <unk> the first time got arrested .

quite the opposite .

<unk> he 's going to the second time with the khmer rouge .
and he was then only a therapy part and then the <unk> .
and there he 'd like he would be their talent for something <unk> can use .
he 's in september , 13 and sentenced to have been , then october <unk> the agency for <unk> started sybase .
the agency 's a right , he can now of life .
he was very good <unk> out .
he 's now here with me .
who would like to figure want you 're talking at him .
it to go back to martin , from what i was to the start telling anybody had .
martin , after his childhood a training to cook , you take and ended up in his hands in the <unk> <unk> .
and alcohol , and drugs and there on the agenda are was his circle of very quickly .
he was working along as though , and to guard .
twenty-one years he ran this life .
and he says , today that it comes back with this fabulous lifestyle to be not existing , <unk> has .
one day to hurt it 's someone at a <unk> so hard that he then a prison was .
he took the <unk> part and that <unk> there 's really his life changed .
he learned , he was like to more force to succeed and too much better life could come up with the air to make juice or without drugs to eat .
and he was about his understanding into so excited that he had decided that would he likes to pass .
and he wanted to be part of <unk> be .
it 's pretty much .
he works well since just two years ago at us and <unk> our participants in their way into the freedom , because he knows , that , if you really change , and if you have the right tools with the hand , that much more is possible , when you often think we want .
the basis of these successes are by people like this .
people that with you entered prison , the of external , with us to come to our participants in their <unk> , with your personal plans to help consult .
that 's our of authority , the <unk> talks in our class , this is that students who <unk> do , <unk> the business plans now you .

and these people take a lot of our program with .
one example .
we do on our , a practice that , <unk> calls .
we 're going into the middle of space a big you’ll enhance our participants must stand on the one and our diners started to stand on the other side .
and i 'm going to different question .
and that every time , if anyone in space that question when you know your answer the kick it on the line .
and here it turns out , what we all together , whether we within the prison are , or outside .
but also , where the differences are .
and an example of , where the differences are , is this question .
i 'm going to a call social a focal point up , or i had a welcomed me what 's gone on in was .
there are usually a lot of our participants in front of the line and just very few of our diners started .
a question that i love to imagine that we all together , the <unk> ' i like you imagine .
and i 'll ask you that they all to get up .
maybe we can be a little light , in the audience .
i can see if you .
there are all .
and that .
thank you .
i 'm singing , you just a question , and if you that question when you know your answer to put them to itself , or we are you just stand .
this is sort of our line that we now it .
i have in my life which things done , and i would be held to be able to it was not true .
if you that question when you know your answer to put them , please .
to count , wasted in the dangers of this .
to count , maybe too low levels of dollars of myself to have .
to count , it with the driving 's actually getting to have .
okay .
and it 's also that might have any workforce , not always completely accurate and for to have .
all right .
most of the auditorium .
we have a few angel in space .
that 's wonderful , because i 'm happy .
thank you , they 're allowed to all back down .
in this question , when we on the events , imagine , get our diners started a lot to start thinking .
and lots of it 's also clear , how much greater happiness , you may have had .
happiness with your parents , happiness with the environment , where they were growing , with your friends , but also been blessed with that you may not always with you could have been if you something on the <unk> or even beyond this did .
what 's the result of our work ?
<unk> percent of our alumni , from inside <unk> days after their released a desktop .
this is expanding very quickly .
a collaborative percent have to navigate autonomously .
one third of donor cycles in the past year went <unk> .
and our <unk> is at seven percent .
i did it already told the <unk> of seven percent is a <unk> in germany , of <unk> percent of the other .
i 'm <unk> .
a <unk> costs in <unk> a year , the 10 thirty dollars .
and it 's a pretty <unk> , calculating , what a <unk> of seven percent of us to a <unk> of usually <unk> percent of a that means .
when my father and i worked on the <unk> have developed , we are quite frankly , a very many to quite nuts , that i had been .
i did n't when my formidable <unk> in a big corporation for dead .
but i must tell you , i stuck in my life 's not as a <unk> work done .
we encourage our participants do , responsibility to take .
and responsibility , what to your life 's happened , and of responsibility for too strongly , what to your life will happen .
not to hide , nothing to <unk> .
because that leads to a whole new social confidence and then gives it also to them back to trust to build .
and therefore it makes me a very happy and pride and when our subjects , frankly , from their way to report .
, i have you a video with me .
roll that .
so i was convicted of two years , and eight months of a dangerous <unk> .
i was prosecuted <unk> against the <unk> to three years , and 10 months , convicted .
i have with dollars of traded .
so , i have a judgment of two years ago , because of a dangerous <unk> .
i was convicted of <unk> and <unk> <unk> with <unk> .
so , through my participation in <unk> , actually my a whole life changed .
and what to me was important , these <unk> that you do .
because there was my yes , my absolute deficit .
i was n't <unk> , i would like , i managed to say , yes .
i 've got to revitalize primary goals of sight and abbott .
i 've got back into perspective , i 've got back to the united states .

and pieces of story more and <unk> without a fixed these goals , and then you know , in and something <unk> .
with the wrong people together and that 's no longer .
well , the problem is that many no health , if they get out .

you know , nothing else .
by this <unk> individual , coaching , however , which there are offered is , up with me just my whole mindset of me remind ourselves , about other , over the interacting with issues , over the interacting with the society , this stuff with me to receive during these 20 weeks after all around .
i 've been <unk> of my first woman in divorce .
and for about six months to live '' i again , along with her .
so that means , we have a new relationship started .
and because i one is also by this whole <unk> and many other things moved made me .
so much , ' i already done .
i 'm with my family back in pure the education started .
i work today in my dream , i would like , i say .
i do 'official ' living in a <unk> to <unk> .
you have that actually acknowledge that it 's very , many people are the fact , like for example , my mentor , now also about this time to figure out and actually going to be yes , i do n't know , <unk> engagement in addition , the support .
i 'm grateful that they were on the idea anybody ever got that they so what do .
i 'm grateful that you could certainly going to it off , and i 'm extremely grateful that i became part of them to be letting me .
there are part of course also all the people , the support that when they were .
i witnessed as i said , with many people at the events , talking , and that crossed again and confirmed , that 's good thing that is kidding .
and so i 'm ' i do you do .
and say , thank you .
they come up with you entered prison .
each of you have something that we need to .
if you our participants in their <unk> mentor , if you know when the <unk> to come from us whether it in the scope of a financial support this is .
if you know , our program in a new <unk> want to wear , very <unk> issue .
you 're talking to go on .
martin sebastian and i are here today .
and look for us on the conversation with them .
thank you .
<unk> i sold at <unk> <unk> for <unk> gloomy <unk> in nepal <unk> .
in a time in the time i was discontented with was .
there 's what if we do things like .
to <unk> it .
the <unk> go .
a sabbatical in the monastery at taking .
there are today 's how many ways as you with dissatisfaction can be dealt with .
and more like you of dissatisfaction can be dealt with .
anyway , i was <unk> also a way .
with my work and so 'n bit about the <unk> .
what i really of <unk> talk to .
and not from real problems .
my problem , i was <unk> and i could tell me very precisely conceived as my life in 10 , i would , 30 years will look like .

and these <unk> i thought was very scary .
about it 's good definition .
in fact , i had an adult <unk> crisis .
professionally , as private .
i did n't fit me to the <unk> way to happen ?
do it me just lazy way ?
or what if i mean <unk> again , my hand ?
and look like , then what happens .
what i come to me wait .
it was so , the idea .
i was in this time , free <unk> at one day .
as i <unk> .
the <unk> for me was also in fear the absolute dream .
you <unk> for the world 's living in very good at night and <unk> this country in a <unk> way , and the way .
<unk> but occasionally be very <unk> countries .
and developing countries where it safe to see , and say , as about <unk> with villages kind <unk> as the fact that they have nothing , so lucky , and joy channels .
this kind of these images and for capitulating to live , but a <unk> way too .
and that , to me after a while the point .
i was that what i did not enough of .
to its face .
and i found a little <unk> of me about a country to write to all that i do n't actually really know .
that i wanted to change .
i wanted to get them further .
to <unk> article , to write can .
and to my personal passion to be breastfeeding .
how you go to better sounding familiar ?
if you with the people who lives .
at the people who lives , at them home .
not in the hotel .
if you to the challenges and with the problems of people really busy .
and so as you with the people who works .
at that was the answer that i wanted to that question to give you could .
and that i wanted to do .
and i wanted something meaningful to do .
i wanted to give something .
something to do good .
and this sense , up with me of all of <unk> more strongly .
i was sent them before i often in developing world , but in nepal and i was just a particularly touched .
until <unk> was there 's a 10 war in the not just end , orphaned , but also really compelling economic and social problems and left .
with an annual income of <unk> dollars , nepal is the poorest country in asia .
and they 'll continue to this rant about the poorest countries in the world .
a quarter of the population lives below the poverty .
nearly one fifth of the population has to malnutrition .
forty percent of the adult can not reading and writing .
all these facts are connected with a lot of personal stories and of that i on this journey , we met with me in a time in the time i was willing and frankly , to change .
in the time i even a difference , i wanted .
and its state after my return of nepal and my decision to suggest .
i quit my job .
and competed for me at the aid .
and i <unk> 's also now , just an excerpt from the answer equity and i on my at received .
because they just a kind of the landfill .
it 's about a serious 'm amazed at <unk> international arbitrage to do .
and not about a <unk> for a <unk> <unk> the divide one degree of time in nepal want to live and a funding of their brief visit searches .
hi ?
what it 's another ?
i bid was really serious about and good .
at least i thought that .
and this answer was a <unk> <unk> .
i was literally flat-lined .
and got tired of course , a very emotional response .
and to happiness has never <unk> .
instead , ' i this sort of very powerful feeling of this is about what good into it to do .
i did it used as a motor , to my own business of reasons .
<unk> .
<unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> .
a company that in fact that 's , what i then looking to have .
because the way , a country , the way around .
the way , a country right to know .
so i do with the people of local life and i can work .
and it 's not anywhere can work , but in to <unk> .
<unk> you can actually in the two words , break .
so karma , and <unk> .
that means that , as a place to you do good karma , can .
in which you do good can .
so this is now 'n little bit <unk> .
but it 's not .
<unk> is a social <unk> business .
we use the tourism , as a tool for sustainable development .
and more specifically what we use <unk> as a tool for sustainable development .
so <unk> , volunteering and unsustainable tourism .
because the people that with us to travel to do a while their brief visit helped volunteering that .
they pay for their journey , as with a lot of the organizers .
but they travel to different .
you live in <unk> .
and the main goal is not as a lot of recovery or as much <unk> but real <unk> exchange .
social engagement .
and <unk> .
to chechnya to our participants in time and qualification , and interests in various projects .
we can go through our work for one , stiff-limbed tourism change in the region , who otherwise , not getting on the classical tourism change before .
because the necessary to infrastructure to do .
for others , we can send sustainable design projects , .
we can determine their sustainable design projects -- and funding .
we 're funded us to a hundred percent of itself .
are also not up to get commissions .
and that 's just for our long <unk> engagement of meaning .
have started so let the work <unk> in nepal .
<unk> year we have our involvement in uganda , drawing down .
and so after about four years turned to us now i 've got married and my husband and i are also hired a team was a <unk> question .
let 's the <unk> away from here ?
or what if we even greater think ?
if we the <unk> even further by saying ?
if we have been sort of social engagement and sustainable , travel to reason ; d in your wholeness doing ?
and so i have the individual <unk> little bit ?
or a special individual <unk> .
that would then basically a new also a company .
a company that manages to corporations do .
in other <unk> but the same culture like <unk> .
we want to this ?
i was the next question .
'n new business ?
sure that we want this .
we love social entrepreneur and their creative companies .
because we buy a ticking .
because we the same language to talk .
because we the same dreams , and dreams .
because we the challenges to understand .
and so there 's in this year <unk> a nurse , given .
<unk> .
and with <unk> do we creative companies in its development and start <unk> we looked through the most people to support .
to be with the participants , entrepreneur , or 330,000 employees of creative companies dealing with individual 's development <unk> .
so <unk> the personal social and <unk> progression of <unk> deniability .
and <unk> the on the <unk> prepare .
the there are at <unk> again .
it 's using the next to a viable <unk> another advantage you have .
he shows a in relatively short order to you remember standing or where you <unk> .
where you may still unknown unknowns to have .
where you may not enough of both flexibly , to <unk> in thinking .
and he shows a on , where you really good is .
there is a his strength of eyes .
it be the creativity , and suddenly a terrific is .
or whether it 's the serenity and found newly admitted to be detected .
and serenity and things we assume that you could n't can change .
and the force , things to change that you can change .
and you can be very much change .
in very short time .
we know that .
one example , to me .

that are five very beautiful women in uganda .
so sad fortunes and with him .
they would assemble these beautiful , that greeted <unk> for years .
and for years was nothing .
because they simply no market for the mortgages .
because they did n't know , as you the quality can improve .
because you nobody has said , which design may be in the question arises .
we wanted to these women help .
and and therefore , in this year as a <unk> started sybase .
<unk> <unk> <unk> .
products that people out of poverty , get .
and you an income levels are .
a future will be possible .
we 're beautifully yesterday with our <unk> 's gone .
and we start with a first <unk> edition .
a <unk> edition of a thousand <unk> of our women .
the bake sale -- brings them not only for a year , an income .
but allows us as well , this project , even more attractive to do .
this first edition is the social crowd , <unk> and <unk> in one .
so who do n't want , this one to purchase a chain of going to the other , it can do with us again directly into the project to travel .
it can go to the women and about travel to actively <unk> .
the long will we 're not only five women a work to give it fifty or a hundred .
and that 's not just in uganda , but also in nepal and in other <unk> , where we <unk> work .
it is , but this <unk> just a project from our new integrated cycle of projects .
we 're in all the core areas .

because the work in the only one area in the most of the same thing is .
what happens in the kids when the women who work ?
right .
so we have in this year in nepal and in uganda and two <unk> centre , started .
everything has gone in our own cycle in .
and all this is more sense , as any one project to yourself .
participants , what we in time and qualification into the various projects .
the exact possibilities are then the only in common good job .
and i 'm going to i 'm now , even just on a journey to bring them .
and i 'll ask yourself , the eyes to close .
i 'm singing , you before you 're in africa .
in rural heart of uganda .
you 're sitting on a <unk> dining room .
and you 're happy , powers-that-be bullshit .
you 've just with your host of had lunch .
there was <unk> .
<unk> .
tasty .
the walls are clearcut .
in there is it comfortable warm .
you <unk> from the window .
and see these kids in the <unk> <unk> <unk> .
their <unk> feet <unk> the sand on .
you <unk> on your <unk> .
also on them is a thin coat <unk> dust .
the kids will laugh .
and calls for fun to your behalf .
you are you that she was no longer just <unk> call .
<unk> .
you know , not , what time it 's .
and now you going to get up .
and the <unk> , on the things that 's the kids were , <unk> .
the end of the street is a tree .
here will you with lydia meet .
in the meadow , sitting in the shadow of the tree as you like the new designs of <unk> talk about .
and as you with my hands and feet .
later , even the other women on this .
they smile , you <unk> on .

the tree .
in free-fall .
remarkably , that there yet the internet is .
this morning <unk> you back with your coach .
that are you .
the exchange is every time value .
it 's also believe in the time again , german , to talk .
you hear music .
and that <unk> of the electric washing machine .
mom fiona is in the courtyard , the pots and down .
they sing an african proverb that song .
you are relaxed , and happy .
you can see it back to do .
each of us , the <unk> , to come to what 's something new in this .
well , for a short time the one , again , to throw .
and to look what happens .
thank you .
before i start , would take interest me , whether of you tonight that they 're here , ever been somebody 'n ' house there 's .
i ' to the light , not that really well , but perhaps want to any sign .
here ' i want somebody .
two .
this up ' i 'm not , but in any rate down here are ever been two , that 's beautiful , we 're ever known to <unk> .
i 've ever seen is also a building up there and it 's the them so that mountain in east , the city <unk> .
this is the building .
together with about the other people , ' i the them in the last summer , six months for there .
and so <unk> ' i here tonight from them .
well , and , like now some of you might say .
what should do it ?
<unk> is what is a lot .
but i want it quickly explain .
oh , which , it occupied by now the them ?
and you <unk> in the park or how ?
just a variety of the questions that as we know , friends , colleagues have asked when you 've learned that i became part of an initiative with what i <unk> ' to , something <unk> name , <unk> am .
all know that we reconnect seamlessly in the front of <unk> <unk> had .
and here , about those of them so <unk> who had , <unk> principles , and the banner , put up did .
and to resist the privatization of them to protesting .
but who i know , you know that 's not my kind of protests .
and it was also not the mayors <unk> the initiative .
what we see here , is a sign of the <unk> passage in <unk> .
this is a public space , the votes for private , and so for many people do n't available to , <unk> ' i do n't say , but it 's not in public hand , and will not so be used , how to public spaces may use .
we were a group of <unk> together in the desire to <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> , particularly and put it .
and we wanted a different <unk> tell .
we were an interdisciplinary team and that i have now a function , because it was a very <unk> team .
from the areas of architecture , urban social -- , politics -- and <unk> <unk> , statistics , design , music , photography <unk> , <unk> and relations .
of course at once again with different social and cultural and personal encounter .
our perspectives <unk> and public concerns itself .
and have allowed us , in different skills , but also in various networks <unk> .
and creative part , living in the solutions in the <unk> , the we then she was , <unk> to realize .
we 've actually navigated directly , the them to people .
however , it 's about saying we sunny villa with stories and ideas of state .
we have to reactivate memories and they asked .
and from these memories and images of trying , of perspectives of them to develop .
and it was we care the process and more constructive ; it remains .
us as an initiative for yourself , we 're always than outside the platform and when <unk> terms .
so i was <unk> a <unk> and emotional signal of state , and , and following a <unk> .
on the experiences that we 've done , <unk> ' i tonight do .
every city has <unk> places .
the a neighborhood a face .

they are the body parts of a city because you just typically not the roots , what we 're going to a public space and expect .
so for example that we <unk> , <unk> have .
are these , but also the in public , the urban places , neglected , this is often talk about lying .
these initiatives , who are places like them back to , are often too <unk> interest in the infancy to do .
what 's also with me to do , like here some questions , like some outside of questions .
i mean , a lot .
these places , giving our town , not just a face .
no .
they are the social places of the city , in our social life places .
so do we there is very first <unk> for a bunch of our neighbors , if we went on the way for all meet .
and get this into details , if we just one can do this is , to sit , and we actually stop , if the spaces are also designed are .
and we just 'n longer you get them .
it 's relationships , sometimes .
but what 's safe to bug 's an experience of community .
ever more profound encounters , i did it in such a public space , `` well , that and more and more , you that community .
and when i do n't <unk> , i come up , the things that , what you probably the anonymous , a big city called .
we were going to two challenges .
we can look at the citizens and consciousness , `` stewardship and engagement for your neighborhood will become intrigued , or in <unk> also <unk> be .
how is a protest in the creation be transformed ?
how can make reasonable criticism in the ideas will be transformed ?
a protest against the privatization , and <unk> this <unk> <unk> places and criticism , against the twin increases , and actually do n't understand , <unk> just the same places .
suppose we now that they sit here , even before , they beat the newspaper on and read the following the text .
i love to re-educate ourselves and citizens , we invite you a we want you three of options for the talk of <unk> imagine that a heck of the <unk> <unk> designed a pedophile .
they 're in the connectivity to the idea of a nuance choose .
and the variation in the most <unk> is then <unk> implemented .
they would go ?
would any of them to this event going ?
perhaps not .
why not ?
i mean , this is just a great .
now , we can do this is , which make .
they ca <unk> how that we going to say `` well .
and as i said , is just a great in the first moment .
i trial strategy '' i still from an explanation .
and that is , because i the opinion , they ca n't really the conversation , or so , or , and , <unk> .
so one , because the classic <unk> often much too late <unk> .
that means mostly they have no opportunity , really , your suggestions to make or basically the alternatives to have , but there are actually have been can design and they ca <unk> to decide , they <unk> or <unk> in the city , green plants .
or , as a friend and other day said , what color the garbage pail , for example .
second favorite explanation that classical <unk> 's rarely spoke about the information and vote out .
think about the three <unk> varieties .
what we have what that we want to show you , and they ca : well .
the frustration and come are often the following what i also kind of the tech-savvy for me .
i certainly would not a decision about <unk> or <unk> meeting when i 'm supposed to be can <unk> route , instead <unk> <unk> had .
it 's but also different .
so for us the existing <unk> many , individuals , we finally too much for being .
it 's talk about what 's picking up and the , i for other <unk> share .
i want it can pass on others have initiatives , in other projects , but also , or of all of the city and at the politics .
because of those who are , the ones <unk> really should be running and the really responsible for these redundant processes are .
if we find is really the interest in a scale , is , how it so often told the and it is then we need and then we need to retrain all new <unk> .
not least <unk> ' i but also to you all that you today , sit here .
and it 's so , because i <unk> 's very important , .
i know , it 's it 's important that they all go , and i want it with our example , encourage , the <unk> a chance to give .
and i connect to me , they all , because they are the ones that to retrain them a new <unk> it can .
so we have to everyone 's going to look around the citizens and consciousness , `` stewardship and engagement for your neighborhood and they feel like to participation and <unk> of controversy .
first about willingness to the dialogue in the field .
in <unk> meet , professionals in layman , citizens of <unk> and varied interests of one .
what we see here , is a picnic table , to the we invited to have .
what we see here , are some <unk> and local authorities in conversation with citizens .
the goal to be that all those conversations on the field on today , so that 's not the <unk> interests , or the <unk> skills across the capabilities of the citizens are .
the citizens of local are experts , they 're experts to their neighborhood , you know what you do , which <unk> deal with a place them , in which they do a place , and also , what you of local missing .
the <unk> , of the city , entrepreneurial , what on <unk> level in the project into this is .
in alone or in in a particular case , then another <unk> be involved in the themes of complimenting , the only on the project tailored to on , so depending on .
it leads to a <unk> , where we all these things for all , and then the place to this can be .
so maybe even trace the can be that an identification of the world .
a dialog with the field ; also means that 's the residents in fact taken seriously , .
and it 's also then , if somebody says , i want to <unk> next to the marketplace .
this is capable of being totally on his , but the goal to be , in <unk> with all those <unk> , which is the right solution and maybe in <unk> then you to <unk> there , but maybe with a different place .
as i said , it has evolved for the dialogue out , and then they have .
second point are lots <unk> .
our <unk> 's colorful .
one is completely comfortable , when he said to <unk> large group , and you can talk .
another one can do it is good writing , but the text , then not on <unk> large group to talk .
another one is what might be happy or the crime .
or building his ideas in <unk> <unk> on .
what i say it tries to have different <unk> give to different groups of course , to be .
we have here for example , the way , just to come , there to be , first time , anyway , what happens .
the back , can small exhibition .
what we have the possibility of them anyway , <unk> to give .
we have the possibility of them anyway , to follow .
we have the possibility of them anyway , to write .
regardless of the age .
that was a <unk> girl .
we had the way , our ideas with their faces to connect to play with ideas to <unk> .
and the way , outside of <unk> <unk> to participate , was always existed .
it can go for example of a <unk> happen , it over <unk> <unk> happen .
and providing and bearing that availability of the results of the dialogue out of them .
we even have the entire process , along on facebook never leaves and on one of independent blog , news <unk> about a newsletter .
our third thing <unk> .
you remember , maybe that i said that <unk> often too late today .
in my <unk> event , we have been three finished the planning .
<unk> 's the process , but only appeased when he early intervention happening and those who at its own did n't even know what to <unk> area happen to .
if through the dialogue , and i 'm going back in one mistake , -- is that futures for an area in the question .
<unk> 's actually also for <unk> itself .
and it 's then , if not to begin with future is that the <unk> event that , and so i look , but on the data from the previous self-assembles .
what happens now , if we think citizens in your city beautiful offices and your city <unk> .
it 's already in a devoted to see .
i 've ever seen an example here from <unk> , this is the <unk> , is probably for many of this well-known .
in new york was just a project started , there 's happening around a <unk> .
in <unk> <unk> there are in six weeks <unk> dollars to come together and it is able to make them or at <unk> .
the time , and in august i wrote the politics , i could n't unlike , as the idea of their own , to do .
and the <unk> in new york , to the i believe that ' i do n't tell you have , because he now , a really the most <unk> the city 's become buddhas was no idea of politics or managing dissent .
the opposite , the <unk> for the <unk> stood on a woman straps .
in <unk> , so we 're back in germany , the people already had plans to very essence of a place again it .
the city was told <unk> is not necessary .
the four weeks <unk> that we for <unk> <unk> , the rich being able to <unk> out .
today is the <unk> the city , offline .
during the side <unk> d 's wonderful work and the city of the <unk> that the initiative that , there 's founded , and other <unk> this .
what we draw the citizens share their own posed into the road .

all seems so far , you want to say .
then we do , but now , just so forth .
but i think it 's wrong , the city of the responsibility to make .
why ?
one , because they 're not a look for a 's all , or should have .
during the dedicated , it be the citizens of initiatives , or businesses , in the rule on one of them in some way , relevant part of focus has the city against the responsibility for reforestation projects that 's also on the attention to stand .
and for some of course , even if the city that homelessness is , the other tools available to .
a <unk> initiative , this sort of the design of those .
and our goal was actually a temporary initiative that after her laugh if given was roughly half a year of the results and the responsibility to the city to hand , i did .
current state of a big investor has the them in january you bought .
it 's run a negotiation .
so we have unfortunately the moment the problem that we the responsibility , not yet it could .
but we know in any case you 've been that , if the city of the of them so successful <unk> , if the negotiation in fact , it was that then a <unk> take place is .
in the form of life is actually more open .
to end up to come i am convinced of that many projects that from their meaning , complexity or even the cost of the city has evolved to a chance of satisfaction to support and our identification get cross-ventilation .
if you just on time , a dialog with the citizens <unk> be .
in each of the city and citizens .
in each of the city and you all that you tonight sit here .
if we put myself in demand and at the policymakers , the <unk> the citizens are no longer than an experience , but rather than everyone .
that 's it .
last night shifts in the dress rehearsal , we were here in <unk> in <unk> and there 's so the <unk> be .
we have <unk> .
so this idea , nor can second chance to have , if it in this life does n't work out that , then just a can second chance .
we found a very exciting .
and we were actually relatively quickly to agree that it 's two things are that we do n't it to live long did .
this is the puberty .
the second , there was also sensitive to yoke , the table to . to school ?
nah .
nah .
school , some of you remember , maybe even more books just out and excel .
at me this is so , are the <unk> years ago , but the words , with me to go to <unk> hands .
my neck that woman straps herself up and i want to go back to get on the loo .
and then i 'm not , how it on you , but in my exams , then always the and have to <unk> taken seriously , who was always beside me .
no idea , what to actually become is .
they 're going to understand it , so , i had n't really nice and after i then my final <unk> behind me was perfectly clear , never again , school .
and what should i now say , when i on this year <unk> look at some of the most days that i think there were spent got tired , have sex pistols ' i in schools and i spent .
with great passion and , be voluntary .
how did it up ?
how could this happen ?
it just started to start to make that something happens is , what i never arrived there was .
i got kids .
so , my wife , the children .
and then they also very clear that they 're going is that to summarize this <unk> to do i had .
to the one day , when she said , honey , it 's <unk> .
and today , do you go .
yes , <unk> .
because i opened the door and then i was sitting there 's basically in this <unk> , whoa , i felt <unk> in the <unk> .
that looked like this right , like that time with us basically .
and that , even more like to school and then it made , and i <unk> ' me , gee , here , it’s real failure of changes .
and when i then the teacher 's say , i heard and you know , the kids learn not for the school , but for a 's live there <unk> ' i , my god , the sentence , ' i mean , then in not <unk> .
what is that , what we look at the school , from this high school actually do for a 's life really them to have ?
so many of us have <unk> there really good thing .
where they 're supposed to your life <unk> ever really well you can ?
and you may have some yet , like the capitol of taking it means .
what 's another time taking place ?
or <unk> , that capacity in short time as much know to <unk> , just so that i do you zoom out of back <unk> , to me what 's going ?
well , i 've ever seen this time needed to <unk> , but otherwise ?
and what 's a <unk> of one point here is about it out whether someone a good doctor 's going ?
if the empathic , and if the good surveys from the properties have ?
nah .
so , we , for a 's life , not for the school , we learn .
if we go back , i was about <unk> years , the middle of <unk> century , there , that might have voted themselves have .
this is the time , in the time in germany , the <unk> then at some understanding of it was introduced .
and where we also the educational , how we now , its roots had .
and if we the time and then imagine , then it was actually so , the people then they had no access to know their time .
and there were these four or six years that they 're kind of forced to have , to school to go and with knowledge of being that were then actually the only way that had to get to know , and the facts and the information in their time with them to come .
now has a <unk> more information in his pocket , when the most of the library of the sort of the time .
and the middle of <unk> century , that was the time the <unk> .
that means there was a big changes in the world and there were suddenly humans need that these new machines controlled could .
simultaneously , but also people , and these machines , and repair our way .
and we did people that these machines , could and these factories and put them .
maybe you see it .
this <unk> school , that we now in germany to thank you are still have , has its root in this time .
and has been there may just self-indulgence .
well , because it was probably really that was that , what i in school because i learned , ' for the work on the assembly line , well , who the assembly line said , who stood there be able to live long .
we do <unk> look at the future .


i was with my job done and i thought , now is the point , now are you walk autonomously , the first company .
yes , after some of me around to the internet , then <unk> ' i , then <unk> ' i do it also now time .
and some corporations are going to us <unk> and they were getting bigger and getting bigger , and we are so beautiful slow growth , and some of the companies are going to us again , so in free fall <unk> .
you can always be two times in life .
and we were then after a few years , but 30 staff .
so , we had such a wonderful growth and we had so exciting potential of jobs , on how <unk> , <unk> <unk> <unk> .
i do n't know , if you can make concrete have a democracy , what these people do , but when you to school , we had no idea that it so what ever was going to .
even when i <unk> did was from so what 's like the web did n't yet stunning talk .
and the kids that we now in to believe the job , the in 10 , six , 20 or 30 years have ?
the only honest answer <unk> we have no idea .
and that you know , which turn facts are the need to get into the future jobs to succeed ?
and if you 're honest , as well , because the only answer , we have no idea .
and because we , so in the future looking , who could give me because the <unk> to a saturday .
there 's <unk> <unk> , have sex pistols ' i read .
well , you see , they have no idea .
how do we figured out , what school for a 's lives learning to make it ?
what are the things that we need to get kids for a 's being unfit to do ?
and maybe playfulness helps , such a peek into in this , what companies today to give employees are .
that this is yes , the <unk> of school , yeah ?
the alumni from schools and the universities , then in the company .
and if you that can see classic <unk> at the course , then , standing there at first place , so what , like the expertise .
here , the yes , so the reading , but here , we 're looking <unk> <unk> <unk> with 10 years <unk> and of 12 years in offshore .
this is going to school right now and in the future ca n't afford .
what school , but may not afford to be , are the things that always important , there are so we call <unk> <unk> and i am i 'm convinced of that these <unk> <unk> the lemonade <unk> the future will be .
and you can in principle in three different groups to summarize .
this is one , businesses , want to give employees , the flexible , and flexibility in this is a .
then you want to almost all companies actually managed to be thinking .
and then you want to these are having employees , the <unk> are .
so we have to their thinking and i ever .
we start with the flexibility in .
this is relatively easy to comprehend .
if we look at , how economies to work , how fast , yes , how fast , anything changes .
<unk> , yes , the whole business models are the internet of today on the morning on the turned upside .
and practice , ' i worked on that with this change can deal .
and practice , ' i worked on that are creative .
and practice , ' i worked , the <unk> are .
this is quite the opposite of what in the plant , the end of <unk> century of employees to the assembly line of all had .
and the second issue that contribute to think is fairly obvious .
there 's happening around the responsibility .
there 's about people that take responsibility .
first time to yourself and their own life .
but also for the big telescope .
if this now , the company , or even when society and wish we people who take responsibility for the big telescope .
and the third thing that ever get that 's almost the most <unk> .
and if we can get to soccer cup remember , then we did that the web and this beautiful saying .
argentina , <unk> <unk> portugal , <unk> and germany has a team .
it was n't naíma <unk> , the world cup 's won .
that could the only in common .
and so somebody , this big one innovator our time , steve jobs , yes , <unk> .
it was not the , of the iphone , invented , who has not the <unk> invented , who has to itunes n't invented , who did n't know about being invented .
who had a team that made this possible , because just as a team was able to do that what they 've done .
so can school that these three things to be that i think about what if you can school , where we for a 's lives learning .
but there 's <unk> fourth item and this is me almost more .
and this is the training themselves .
if the only , what you over the future , safe to say , this is that you an uncertainty is that 's quite the ability , again and new to learn and fun and to have this learning to experience that is paramount , that we in their lives , and that our children in their lives are successful .
this about vermeer 's what if you can school that these things that .
but where i was ?
i sat in this <unk> and the of them , the children , who know that 's not just can event , for the you <unk> have to pay .
so can event of like all it said , but not yet from each other .
to the point , where <unk> 're elected , there are then suddenly all the invisible .
yes , i sat there and what can i say , at the <unk> one of my kids were these <unk> even the funniest parts of the event .
less fun , it was for me as a father , as if that the stress around the subject of homework and learn the entire life <unk> .
and even less fun makes it , if the child sick , because in school in this is now .
and finally ended up these <unk> or was a peak of <unk> of school will be so 'n <unk> .
in fact , and it was no <unk> , it was rather , such a <unk> , so immediately after the last time , and in fact , we were also the single parents , who were invited .
and i <unk> ' you now and me to detail by the time after the point was clear , we need to our child , because the pointer , it does n't .
<unk> , but two years , where we noticed they have , there 's something wrong .
what do we really wrong ?
and we 'd actually the question is turned it 's our child to ?
and we are the only , they do you go ?
now , ' i in the last two years ago , since i said in the subject , with lots of people talking and i 've ever realized , nah . i 've ever learned , you 're not alone .
there are plenty of , where it very similar to go and that has two years ago , because i was sitting with <unk> flourmill will bring together , we were just about , a new to privatize many reasons , by us about , where the journey , there goes , and night , we sat on the bar and have spent about us , things of war .
and what can i say , he kept me almost the same story with one of his children he 's almost equal is how we , and that we had been fortunate that we our children that means we could look at the school , yeah ?
in berlin , there 's one can <unk> at different schools and we could even the charter schools in play it .
but can that anyone out there are doing ?
somehow were the of the same , our children in safety to take out and these ones , it out there 's able to be , how they are .
and after we both right now the sense of them , school , since we were there is not that really changed we thought , yes , we are the first , the topic that now let go .
just , how shall we as <unk> there anything to change ?

we 're not alone .
but we have a relatively quickly can of amazing people that were found something similar to how we , which can you do that all of them to this is .
it 's not like that 's the children and their parents to suffer , which comes out there 's often happens .
if we the teacher at the way , 30 percent of teachers have <unk> .
if we look at , as the number <unk> in the last decade has changed who has doubled .
can do n't be that all parents , which is going wrong ?
that all children down , and that as those teachers to specialize ?
or it can be that 's a school , that just ca n't like that fit , like this <unk> of <unk> years , who fits to do n't like that right .
and we have many people found , they do similar , and we 've even people found that are not have children .
and they 've understood that they become committed to the future that they become committed to the future , if you take responsibility for events that we our children and the kids , the right now to school , with on the way to give .
and we lobbied on <unk> second point gotten there are out there can of like you have initiatives , the school to change want , and there are there 's <unk> schools , here and there really <unk> and there 's almost on every school teachers that are really involved , and a difference , will .
and there 's even the one or other brave principal , the , then also <unk> the first step to go .
and how we should now as <unk> help ?
we had been no concept that we there 's about helping us could .
but we can one thing , we can into those schools , and we can in these schools , that people , the school is , so the parents , the teachers and the students , together and we can with which within two days you can of us move .
there are so people together , the in the past more so each other 've worked and the learning in two days , what it 's going to get to work .
they come with <unk> in a huge concrete challenge that they made up solving .
and after two , so many days , and then for example , a new <unk> developed sooner or the gun -- both for you can totally new to high as we of the berlin has gone to just come with anywhere .
or they needed some concrete things for <unk> problems that you in your school , evolved .
in two days after all of attempts , the next day , of it can be .
but what 's the most importantly , which at those two days is , and that makes it for me that 's got the small weekends , and i 've got tired , then you look at school in all of germany to spend , is that energy , and it arises when the three things to learn .
if the three things together to experience , which is something so how to accountability .
so we kind of their thinking and if you to be a need to experience .
that 's such a spark that <unk> .
and if we are four weeks after that <unk> workshop to that can school principals come back then what we that comes to the school as a whole started , to change , there is that can totally new culture , is .
and this is incredible hot .
and i <unk> 's what you reinvent ourselves about education was thinking .
i <unk> ' they just like , about education was thinking .
and i <unk> ' they of also like , it , over the school , to talk .
you 're talking about this , what you like , but you 're talking also do that , what you do n't like .
they 'll be surprised , how much for you get and how many people the same have seen , but just not talking about it .
so let 's so let 's every single drop in germany , the <unk> century of them .
so let 's the entire system .
and let 's this together to do with the people to school day for a day off , with your parents , the teachers and the students .
because all together , we do this .
thank you .
