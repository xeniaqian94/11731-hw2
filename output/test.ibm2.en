when steve lopez , funny the los angeles times , one day through the streets of the center of los angeles , i went , i heard it 's a beautiful music .
they came from a man , an african-american space , <unk> , notoriously rough , are homeless , the on a violin and we did that 's two strings , i had .

nathaniel left <unk> , suffered a <unk> and 30 years later he was going to commemorate the streets of <unk> row in the center of los angeles .
i recommend you all , <unk> book to read or to the audacity to watch , so they can not just the beautiful band -- understand that between these two men , is , but also , like the music that connection to make it did and how they finally this instrument was , if this pun and allows is that <unk> , nathaniel away from the street .
i met an mr <unk> in 2008 , two years ago , to walt disney <unk> hall .
he had just a demo of beethoven 's first and fourth symphony of them and came out of the stage , to me around .

we came to the subject of music to talk . and a few days later i received an email , in the state that nathaniel to get lessons at my interest .

as an example of it 's now , especially vulnerable to the schizophrenic stages . they 're sometimes that bad , and he for days away , in the streets of <unk> row <unk> , and the horror and the <unk> his own mind 's exposed .
and in precisely such a <unk> was nathaniel , when we do with our first have to walt disney <unk> hall , began . he had this just <unk> in his eyes and this seemed completely lost .
he talked about the invisible , demons and smoke and it , how to anyone in my sleep , a wanted .

i started so easy to play .
i was the first set of beethoven <unk> .
and while i was playing , i noticed in that in <unk> eyes a full of saying to go .
it was , as if it under the impact of an invisible to deliver it said , a chemical response , of the catalyst for my game was .
<unk> <unk> anger , in understanding , in one of curiosity and the grace .
and the way through a miracle , he took a violin and started , after the ears in some clips from <unk> to play and asked me then , them out to play , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> .
we then , about music to talk , starting from the stream of design , <unk> , <unk> and all the other <unk> , of <unk> to <unk> <unk> .
and made me realize that he 's not just a <unk> know about music owned , but it with her as a tight personal relationship to help .
he talked about her with a passion and an understanding that else i just about my colleagues in philharmonic , of los angeles to know .
by looking at the music playing and about music , talking , from this <unk> , confused man that you go around the streets of los angeles , i found that was , a particularly adorable , <unk> , <unk> , in <unk> oxford-trained musicians from there .
music 's medicine . music is us .
for nathaniel does n't listen to <unk> health .
because the music , it allows him , his thoughts and delusions with his imagination and creativity in a real to convert .
and so <unk> his agonized situation .
i understood that that the essence of art is .
that 's the reason , why we do n't listen to do : so we do something that in all of us , deep inside , is , our feelings , by our artistic lens , through our creativity to the fact , shape can .
and the fact that expression of hit us all , and moves , inspired , and it unites us .
what nathaniel terms , that took him the music back into a community of friends .
the <unk> force the music took him back into a family of musicians that he understood that might be a talent , and it started paying attention .
and i 'm going back to nathaniel music , we asked to walt disney <unk> hall , or in <unk> row , because he this reminds me , why i brought musicians from there 's me .
thank you .
bruno giussani : thank you . thanks .
robert gupta .
robert gupta : i 'd like to play , that i <unk> the by a plaster original plan .
i hope that they excuse me .
so i have in my life , many fish -- sharing .
i 've only two very popular .
this first , this was more like a passionate affair with .
it was a wonderful dog , <unk> , the best meat , <unk> , a best-selling book on the menu card .
what a fish .
even better , he was in <unk> after the prison on top tiers of standards of sustainability of seeing .
you could be so i feel about , it to sell it .
i had with this beauty of a sense of several months .
one day , called the head to the company , and said , i be in an event , poetry could about the sustainability in the farm .
`` of course , '' i said .
there was a company that to solve was assertive , what this tremendous problem for our chefs 's become . how do we fish in our menus ?
in the last 50 years we have the ocean of how we forests , to re-grow clearcut to have .
it 's hard , the destruction of <unk> .

it 's almost nothing more recent labor .
so is arguably , or not one <unk> , <unk> , a part of our future .
a lot of arguments against . <unk> pollute the environment , the most of them anyway , and they are inefficient , let 's really tuna . a big disadvantage .
he has a <unk> of 15 to one .
that is , 15 pounds of wild fish are necessary , so you a pounds <unk> get .
not very sustainable .
it tastes and not very good .
so here was finally one company , who tried , it right to do .
i wanted you 'd come .
the day of the event , i called the head of the public relations with the company .
we call him , don .
`` well , don brownlee , '' i said , `` just about the aggregate them right to have , you are famous for , so far out in the sea the moment , you to the environment is not an aquifer . ''
`` well , '' , he said , `` we 're so far out that the waste from fish and distributed , not here . ''
and then put it uses x-rays , `` we 're essentially a own world .
these <unk> of <unk> to 1 , '' he said .
`` the best in the industry . ''
<unk> to one , great .
`` <unk> to become , what ? what she feeds on her ? ''
`` that proteins , '' he said .
`` awesome '' , i said . put on .
and at that night , i was in bed and i thought , what the hell is a sustainable protein ?
so i called the next day , just before the event , don levy this .
i said , don brownlee , which for example , sustainable and proteins that ? ''
he said , he had n't that . he 'll <unk> .
now , i get on with a few people in the company . nobody could give me a boatload answer , until i finally , to the directors , biologists on .
we call him as well , don .
`` well , don brownlee , '' i said , `` what for example , sustainable and proteins that ? ''
now , he told you some algae and some <unk> , and then he said , <unk> .
i said , `` <unk> ? ''
he said , `` yes , do , skin , <unk> , redwood rainforests , <unk> and to get together . ''
i said , `` how much percent of your <unk> 's chicken ? `` well ,
in the assumption of maybe two percent .
`` well , that 's about 30 percent , '' he said .
i said , don brownlee , which is deeply about , chicken at the fish to the field ? ''
there was a break in the vocals and he said , `` there 's just too much chicken in the world . ''
i <unk> me about this fish .
no , not , because i was a <unk> <unk> and <unk> am .
that i 'm actually .
no , i 've <unk> in this fish <unk> , because , i swear to god , the fish on this entertainment , for chicken anise in senegal .
this second dog , that 's a different kind of love story .
it 's the romantic sort of , the way , where you , ever better and his fish , learns , you the fish that the more love .
i photographed him to get started to a restaurant in <unk> potatoes .

she brought us in a set .
he came on the table with a light , almost bathed an color .
the chef came with him <unk> .
to be twice .
but it was still delicious .
who can be a fish that level of delicious , after he <unk> was ?
i ca n't , but this guy , it .
we call him miguel sokoloff . actually does he miguel sokoloff .
and no , he has the fish no , cooked , and he 's not a chef . at least on the way that you and i have to understand .
he 's a biologist in <unk> la <unk> .

it 's near the <unk> of the river <unk> .
to the 1980s , the farm in the hands of <unk> .
they grew <unk> on , which is what the wetlands and they were .
they took this , by the country <unk> .

now , they could n't make that was fine , not economic .
and ecologically and it was a catastrophe .
it took about 90 percent of birds in fact , which for these places , many birds are .
and so , 1982 , a spanish company with being bought that land .
what they 've done ?
they have the rivers of water around .
they 've literally the learnings <unk> .
instead of the water <unk> did they the channels , about the water again <unk> .
they <unk> the channels .
they created a 11,000 acre <unk> -- <unk> , <unk> , the shrimp , reclusive eel -- and a problem is miguel , and its trajectory of the environmental destruction all around .
the farm is incredible .
i mean , they have something that 's never seen .
they are staring at the horizon , the one million miles away , and everything you see are <unk> channels and that population density , for their bullets .
i was there , he did n't long time with miguel sokoloff .
he 's an incredible guy , three parts of charles darwin and part `` a crocodile , to do .
okay ? there we were , and i fought alongside us through the wetlands and i <unk> and <unk> , rolled up to my knees , and miguel , in mind a <unk> .
here , picks it 's a rare <unk> forth .
now beginning , he the <unk> of phytoplankton .
and here , here it does a pattern of them together , that it in the taken a giraffe , remember .
it turns out that miguel most of his career in <unk> national park in africa has spent .
i asked him , he was like to such a <unk> 's become .
he said , fish ? i know nothing about the fish .
i 'm an expert in the relationships . ''
and then he leaves , and dropping off to be more than instant of those rare birds and algae and strange <unk> .
and do n't get me wrong , this was really fascinating , you know , the biotic community <unk> , so in the way .
it 's great , but i was in love .
and my head was sick of this <unk> piece of this fish that i am <unk> had .
so i put him over . i said : miguel , is it that your fish that level of delicious ? ''
he showed up with the algae .
`` i know , boy , the algae , of phytoplankton , the relationships , it 's unbelievable .
but what we eat your built-in fish ?
how is the <unk> ? ''
now , he goes on me to tell that it 's a rich , that the fishes better food , what you in the wild and eat it would .
the royal vegetable biomass , to phytoplankton , the <unk> , this is it , what the fish have a baseball .
the system is so healthy , it 's completely <unk> .
it 's no food .
i 've heard of a farm , the service of animals not a baseball ?
later on day i went on this site of which is miguel , and i asked him , i said , for a place , the way of seems to be . '' do differently than any rural farm , on the i ever been , `` how is you 're doing ? ''
in the moment , it was , like a hoffman a <unk> order to have .
and we used to the corner and we 've offered to the most incredible ; it , thousands and hundreds of pinker flamingos , a literally , pinker carpet and so far from the eye , gives us .
`` that 's success , '' he said .
`` check out their bellies on , pink .
they <unk> . ''
<unk> ? i was just confused .
i said : miguel , <unk> they 're not your fish ? ''
`` yes , '' he said .
`` we 're lost 20 percent of our tofu store fish and <unk> at the birds .
now , last year went on this site 600,000 , birds , more than 50 and different species .
it 's going to the largest and one of the major commercial <unk> throughout europe .
i said : miguel , is a good <unk> <unk> not the last thing that you on a <unk> have to ? ''

he said , we build <unk> , not continuously .

the flamingos , and eat the shrimp .
the shrimp , and eat the phytoplankton .
ever , pinker so the gut , better , the system . ''
okay , let 's the way . a farm , the service of animals not a baseball stadiums and a farm that pummel their success on the health of her to measure .
a <unk> , but also a <unk> .
oh , and by hitchhiking , this flamingos covered by the position do n't even be there .
they breed in a city 240 million miles away , where the surface is better for the maintenance .
every morning to fly it comes 240 million miles to farm .
and every night . fly it comes 240 million miles away .
they do that because they the <unk> white line the highway <unk> be able to .
seriously .
i had a kind of travel throughout the penguins had presented factually , so i miguel sokoloff .
i said : miguel , fly it comes 240 million miles of the farm and fly you that comes 240 million miles back on the evening ?
do it for the children ? ''
he looked at me , looks like i just a song from the whitney , and houston , quotes .
he said , `` no . they do that because the food is better . ''
i do n't have the skin of my beloved fish mentioned , the most delicious , and i do n't like <unk> . i like this is not <unk> . i like this is not crunchy food .
it 's this is positively scathing , <unk> flavor .
i 'm almost never leave that .
and yet , when i told them in this restaurant in <unk> attempted , she did n't even after <unk> anise .
she liked the sweet and in the thing , as if you a half bites by the ocean is where dignity .
i mentioned that to miguel , and he kind of .
he said , `` the skin and it looks like a sponge .
she 's the last firing , until something in the body happens .
it 's turned over the evolution has evolved to <unk> 's resources . ''
and then put it uses x-rays , but our water has no <unk> . ''
okay . a farm that your fish do n't a baseball . a farm that pummel their success is the success of its predators .
and then i was clear , if he says , a farm , which do n't <unk> , <unk> he 's powerful , because the water , this is through this farm and it comes from the river <unk> in .
it 's a river , the all the things that 's to lead , by those rivers , today , and as we tend , if you want to lead , chemical pollutants , the runoff from <unk> .
and if it was retreating through the system , fought , and this information -- is the waters clean , when it <unk> is .
the system is so healthy , it cleans the water .
so not just a farm , the service of animals not a baseball , not just a farm that pummel their success on the health of predator 's , but a farm , who literally a <unk> is , and not only for those fish , but also for you and me .
because if the water <unk> , <unk> it in the atlantic .
a drop in the ocean , i know , but i took him , and that you should do too , because these love story , what romantic , and that 's also telling .
you might argue that you a recipe is the future of good food , whether we of <unk> or <unk> talk .
what we now , it was a radical new concept of agriculture , from one , in the food in fact , delicious .
but for many people like this is a little bit of radical .
we 're not a realist , we <unk> . we 're lover .
we love <unk> . we love this little <unk> . we 're talking about regional food . we eat organic .
and if they claim that the things are , the future of good food goes further , represents somebody somewhere on and says , `` hey guys , i love the pink flamingos , but how they will feed the world ?
how they will feed the world ? ''
i must be honest ?
i like this question is not .
no , not , because we 've been enough to have to produce , the world more than just to feed .
one billion people are today still die .
one billion -- which is more than before -- because <unk> that exist in the distribution , not the emissions .
now , i like this question is not , because it 's the logic of our <unk> the last 50 years ago about it has .
these grain of the herbivores , <unk> to know monocultures , chemicals in the planet for chicken at the fish , and all the time has the grain being just wondered : `` if we more people less feed , how awful it can be ? ''


this is not a viral profession , and it is n't agriculture .
our <unk> is today face , not based <unk> <unk> , but because <unk> resources ,
not by the latest <unk> and <unk> , but through the fertile one country , not by a pump , but through fresh water , not by a chainsaw , but through the forests , and not moving across boats , and nets , but through the fish in the sea .
they want to feed the world ?
so let 's start with the question : how we 're not feed itself ?
or better , how we conditions do that every community to enable , asking yourself to feed ?
and to do , you look not on the <unk> for the future .
it 's really old , and it 's done .
capital , chemistry and machines are in <unk> and it has been something really good for food produced .
so let 's what the green model for .
this is that in two billion years of employment resorts to .
so look , miguel , farmers how miguel ,
businesses that did n't worlds for themselves are , factories , the projects , instead <unk> , factories , the <unk> growing some rather than just worked closely , farmers , the not just the second-highest are , but experts , for connection ,
because they are ones that also hired experts to flavor is .
and if i really honestly , you are a better , chef , when i ever be going .
you know , this is me , right , because if that the future of good food is , it 's delicious .
thank you .

so , what we see here 's a typical <unk> after the age , arranged .
this program that i 'm running here , is a little experiment .
it 's <unk> and what i do with <unk> can do this is that i after a certain death , they can , if you got an accident .
and instantly i see a different patterns that to give you .
and that is , because in <unk> here the people at the <unk> , and they 're moving over the <unk> are .
we can one more step out and sort of the data , and then , and see that <unk> and cancer the usual suspects , but not for everyone .

and who <unk> see that this is especially in a man is true .
they 're so that the reputation of information and data in this way , to swim in a living <unk> mind .
and if we do believe this data can do about why do n't even for the content matters ?
what we now have here are the <unk> every single , `` the espn <unk> '' that whoever figures out there were .
it 's all right here . it 's everything online .
it can like to my talk to her into the test .
with <unk> you can be able to pull in a decade .
they can go to pull in a particular year .
they can go directly to a view from jumping .
now if i here at night , i see the athlete that in this issue some rash appear and the play .
i 'm a lance armstrong 's a fan , so click , i look here , which to me all expenses that show where you have lance armstrong mentioned will .
now , when i just a <unk> of get me , i think , `` ok , what if i all with the subject , biking back at the ? ''
so i walk a step back and <unk> the perspective .
now i see , greg <unk> .

you do something that actually a little bit different is .
it 's something between , and we think it changes the way , and the way information can be used .
i 'd like this idea now a little more to do with about what a little crazy is .
so here we 've done is , we have any of <unk> fact , and it on a little summary of recurrence .
the ipcc summary , contains a little shifts and a symbol of the area of it comes .
i 'm just to the top five centuries of the most <unk> .
but even in this <unk> view , we can a lot of things .
immediately , we have an idea of the themes that on wikipedia , the lines are .
i 'll discuss this topic <unk> '' vote .
now , after i <unk> 's binary simpler , i do that the <unk> that , most so , `` time contents of `` people of the year , '' are .
this is really important , because this one thing is that 's not in a single <unk> 's inside .
this is just to see if you one step back and the entire at .

now if i all these people think of time i do that the majority of <unk> are . some people come from the science . some , even less , come from the economy . here 's my head . and one comes from the <unk> .
and interestingly , bono 's also a ted prize winner .
so we can be to jump , and a look at all the ted prize winner .
you see , we were the board the first time as if it also really a net is , not just by side of the side , but much more abstract .
and so i want you what else to show what a little surprise could be .
i 'll show you here just the new york times website .
<unk> , this app -- i want it 's not a browser , call it ; it 's not a browser , but you can websites to look at -- and we bring these <unk> to each individual site like this .
so i can one step back , and just a particular unit jump .
this is that 's important , because you just through that at the way of websites that kind of ways , , all the <unk> in the same kind of ways , look can .
so i can in my way zoom in a certain time .
here is the state of all of the demonstration project that i 'll see here , that i 've .
and i can sort everything that i 'd have been considered , back .
and , when i write another one step <unk> and on all look , i think the new way , after my <unk> . here , i have to <unk> ' `` for , here in , bing , right here to live , ' <unk> .
and of this is , i in the end to get inside and they 're back to gangstabucks.com .
it 's a metaphor that again and it 's used , and every time , it makes this picture larger than the sum of the pieces .
the moment , in this world , we think that data a curse those are .
we 're talking about , cursing the <unk> .
we talk from `` are drowned in information .
what , if we this situation around you could and the internet on the head , imagine , so that we instead of people talk about one of the other to go , start by many things too many things go to , and this pattern recognition , what otherwise these mounds on with that would be ?
if we do that , then it 's such that <unk> , maybe a new source made more information .
and , instead , just in information to move , we know it to get .
and if we know that experience , then we can maybe even the wisdom of it .
so i hear on , thank you .
i grew up with one , well , helping science fiction , on .
in my high school , i went to the bus to school , every day an hour a way .
and my nose was always going to a book , a <unk> that my mind in other worlds <unk> and on <unk> way that i feel deep within me that blogging posture , amazing , curiosity <unk> .
this structure out and that i always , when i 'm not in school , through the forests <unk> , and `` samples . '' he collected , frogs and snakes and the beetle , and <unk> , all back home , and under the microscope of .
i was totally <unk> , you know .
it was about people talk about the trial , the world to understand and the limits of figure out .
and my love to science fiction , it seemed to live in my surrounding these kantian categories , but then , in the late '60s , we went to the moon and exploring the deep sea .
jacques cousteau came in our room with his sample . shows that we animals and places and a world of miracle that showed that we 've never would we can imagine .
it 's then i just fine of the <unk> <unk> .
and i was an artist .
i could draw . i could paint .
and it does n't play video yet these <unk> with computer-generated movies , all the painting in the media , i had the images in my head to create .

my response to it was the drawing , and paint by aliens , alien world , robotics , futuristic spacecraft , and all so what .
in <unk> i was constantly talking about the teachers get one , i , in the hidden , <unk> .
the had to somehow get out .
and i was something interesting . what i can see , you to jacques <unk> shows that fascinated with was the idea to us that unfamiliar world here on our planet itself .
certainly would i never an alien world with a one-person spaceship , for . it seemed to me very unlikely .
but there was a world that i actually enter , here on the earth , and she was also fascinating and exotic as all that , what i always wanted them , when i these books used had .
so i decided , when i was 15 , scuba to be .
the only problem with it was , i in a tiny village in canada , living , 1,000 kilometers from the next ocean away .
and i let me , but not <unk> .
i do whatever my father , until he finally , a <unk> in <unk> , new york , an had made , right on the other side of the border , where we lived .
i made my <unk> in a pool of <unk> the winter , in <unk> , new york .
the ocean , but , a real ocean , i received only two years later to face , when we to california , which .
since , in the 40 years , the now , apology and there are , i 've got about three thousand hours , under water spent . 300 hours of them in <unk> .
and i 've learned that the world , the deep , even in the <unk> oceans , so rich with <unk> life is , how we really hardly anyone can imagine .
the realm of nature does n't know , borders , it in contrast to our own , <unk> human imagination .
to the present day i just utter awe of events that i on my early dives , i see .
and my love to the ocean is , in this same intensity as jesus , and ever .
when i then as a profession <unk> , it was the <unk> .
it seemed to the best way , my inner drive , stories to tell , with my desire , images to create , to be together .
as a kid , i do all the comic books and so .
so , films , the way , images and stories <unk> . that fit together .
so of the stories that i <unk> , from the science fiction , `` the terminator , '' `` aliens , '' and `` <unk> .
in `` <unk> '' i was my penchant for the yourself and that dip to <unk> together .
now interlocked , of my two passions .
you see something happened with `` <unk> '' : for a <unk> problem in this video to solve -- and that we had such a kind of liquid <unk> create -- , attacking we 're a computer-generated animation , <unk> , back .
how this , it the first computer rendering <unk> that ever going to a film to see that was .
the film was it 's no money one , just joking that he just hit his was a , but i noticed something fascinating , the audience around the world was like it was mesmerized by the magic that the left forcing .
according to arthur koestler , `` against it 's law , are <unk> technology and magic to come from to tell them .
they saw so something magic .
and that i thought was terribly exciting .
and i thought , `` wow , it has done anything in the cinematic be involved . ''
so we go into the terminator , two , '' my next movie , much further .
together with <unk> -- we see in the types of liquid metal . the success , blackness of one , like this effect at the gospels .
and it worked . again , we had something magic is created . and the effect in the audience was the same . but we have to the film , a bit more money <unk> .
of these two experiences from , was a whole new world is , a whole new world of creativity to <unk> .


that we did then also , and lead us as a while a competitive .
but the middle of the '90s years , we realized we believe that we in <unk> and <unk> -- what we the company is actually started having -- to slow <unk> .
i had this piece `` the avatar . '' written that the <unk> in terms of visual effects and <unk> effects in the whole new heights , push them , with lifelike human , expressive characters , the extracting <unk> been produced was . and the <unk> should all <unk> be . and the world ought <unk> be .
but the <unk> and as a heck away . and people in my company that told me that we temporary , let 's not able to be that to create .
so then shifted to and made this other film about the big ship , that goes down .
the <unk> i have the term `` romeo and juliet on a ship . '' he sells . it was a <unk> were to the amount , a passionate about film .

why i put the movie .
this is the truth . the studio , i knew that 's not true .
i put them yet convinced , so i said , we 're going to the wreckage . we see that the wreckage .
we 're in the <unk> of the movie show .
this is hugely important . it 's a good -- for marketing . ''
and i <unk> you , an expedition to finance .
sounds crazy . but that goes back to that , that your own imagination a reality rendering it can .
we then we 've actually six months after a reality , in the time i was in a russian <unk> thrust , four kilometers of the surface of the north atlantic , and i from the real titanic , through a <unk> was looking .
this was not a movie , not definition from , which was really .
so , now i was really just blew .
and the setting up there were enormous . we had camera and the light , and all sorts of building .
and i fell on , how much of these <unk> , a <unk> close .
well , they were also <unk> and <unk> <unk> planning .
you ascend up in the capsule , and hover above you in this dark , hostile environment , down , where the situation is to saving enough , when you do n't it yourself backwards .

this is really cool . ''
i was really obsessed with the study the deep .
so on out of this that with curiosity and science to do you have . it was it . it was exploring , it was curious . it was an imagination .
and it was an experience that i from hollywood would n't give you could .
because , you know , i could a creature here , for that we then a visual effects of intuitive way . but i could n't imagine that , what i was outside of a would see .
go in the following expeditions i have creatures in <unk> seen , and sometimes these things that i 've never seen before , sometimes even things that anything yet nobody ever seen before , and for that science to point , and when you saw that 's no words , he had found .
now i was so really transformative , and i wanted more .
and so i met , then a slightly unusual decision .
after the success of `` titanic '' i told me , `` okay , i want to my <unk> as a filmmaker , in hollywood goes on the melting down and i 'm going to a while <unk> . ''
and we then , we came to `` the bismarck in , and they were exploring with <unk> .
we went to cover up the titanic .
we took a little robot that we built , the a <unk> <unk> .
our intention was , <unk> and to the insides of the ship to watch , what you 've never done was .
nobody had ever the insides of <unk> atlantic . you had it 's no cure for . so we have developed build a technology .
well , and i 'm sitting i now , on the deck of the titanic , in a <unk> , and i see <unk> that <unk> here 's quite similar , and of which i know that once the band , there 's hair has .
and i fly with a little <unk> through the aisles of the ship .
i 'm going to it 's just really , but my mind is inside of the car .
it felt , when i 'd be physical spaces inside of <unk> the titanic , and there .

this is set , which is an exact replica of the <unk> of the ship .
so that was an extremely strange and experience .
they made me this <unk> realized that you have such <unk> or , you use and so that own consciousness in the vehicle , in these different form of existence is can .
it was incredibly profound
and perhaps a brief reference to events that maybe in a few decades , could happen , if you <unk> , around something to explore , or other things to do , in all kinds <unk> <unk> that i as <unk> can imagine .
after these expeditions we started this , what we sat down there had seen , really appreciate to learn , for example , these <unk> , where we these amazingly , and animals , . this is basically any aliens , but here on earth .

they are not in a on the sunlight raw material value system , how we do that .
and so you see animals , the right next one of 300 degrees are you to survive there can .
the same time was i also very interested in <unk> , i 'm going to the <unk> from my childhood .
and so i ended at the people that was dedicated to space were interested and with the nasa harnesses to have now , a <unk> sit and the right <unk> plan . they 're in russia , through the mission of the biomedical enterprise , which get all its bells and whistles , and then the international <unk> and take our <unk> with .
this was fascinating .
but the end , it was going to come out that i <unk> with us in the deep thought it .
i took them with and <unk> you access to the world upside down there , <unk> , <unk> , people who chose to such extreme conditions interesting . i took them to the vents at mit , to make them around , rehearsals and take and instruments ; it could and so forth .
we turned to documentaries no , in there , but in science , specifically , <unk> .
so , the cycle of my existence as <unk> , then as a kid , and the execution in the reality .
in over these irreversibly , i have a lot of them .
i have a lot of science entirely new way . but now i think they certainly , a director to you can lead , a leader be like a <unk> or something .
i understood , but not a lot of leadership , before i this research expeditions <unk> .
because of a particular point i had to tell me , `` what i do is actually here ?
why i do it ? what comes out of it ? ''
this would all of films to bring us no money one .
we 're going to the costs a . of fame have no .

i 've all these films , the documentaries no , for a very small audience .
not a fame , not honor , no money . what are you do ?
you 're doing it around the task will , to the challenge will -- and the ocean is the challenging and environment that there are . you 're doing it 's <unk> because , and because of obscure , shown that creates , if a small group of people 's a team , forming .
because we have all this with only 10 or 12 people did that for about non-stop , and we have . sometimes we were two or three months , rounds at sea .
and in this community you see that the most important thing that anything is that you to each other , because you a job to get done , and nobody else can explain .
if you on land back and to say , `` we had to do it , this fiberglass , the <unk> , and this very precise idea , the whole technology , and the trouble , the human <unk> , if you look at sea , '' , then you can this other just ca n't explain . that 's like in the police officer or at the soldiers that something together through , and you know that they never discriminated can explain .
there 's a connection , one of each other respect .
when i came to my next movie `` the avatar . '' to turn , i tried to the same managing to use , which is that you may be a respected and , in return of respect you need .
it was the dynamic really changed .
because i was so again with a small team up with unknown field . we turned an avatar . '' with a new technique that it before , they have n't .
it 's incredibly exciting .
a challenge for us .
and we went for a period of four and years of the family .
so this changed my way , films to do , completely .
there were people , who said , we have these <unk> is really good and put it and on the planet , until pandora 's more .
for me , it was more a <unk> way , my job to do , the actual process , the to the result has changed .
what we can so from all of finish ?
the lessons we 've learned ?
i think , at first place is the curiosity .
it 's the most powerful of human quality .
our imagination is a force that even a reality rendering it can .
and the be aware of your team is important than all <unk> this world .
come to me a young , filmmaker , who say , you give me a practical advice , i do something that can do . ''
and i say , `` <unk> you do n't even a .
that tape around other for you . do it does n't stop ourselves to bet you 're not going to itself . but to take risks on you . ''
the nasa has been so a <unk> , `` failure is no option . ''
but in the art and the study to fail as an alternative to be , because there , i guarantee it make them making .
no big endeavor , that innovation called for , has ever done without risk of view .
you must be ready , these risks to take .
it was the idea , the i like to handle on the way to give you want . failure is quite an alternative , fear but it 's no . thanks .
today i 'm going to you about energy and climate .
and this surprised , maybe something , because , my <unk> at the foundation , mostly around storage and seed is to the things that we self-construct , and deliver need to the poorest two billion a better life to happen .
but energy and climate is incredibly important for these people , in fact , even more than for each other on planet .
<unk> means that their <unk> over many years , not going to grow . it 's too much or not enough of rain . the things are going to this change , how it their <unk> environment is not the endurance can .
this leads to <unk> . it leads to the uncertainty . it leads to riots .
so , is a climate is terrible for you will .
and it 's the <unk> for you very important .
in fact , that , if you just from one thing the price down could , to <unk> would have to anywhere near the most effective .
now , the <unk> is about the time , like .
actually is the <unk> on <unk> .
the <unk> roamed the industrial revolution in and even in the 20th century . there was a rapid transition space of the <unk> and so there 's the refrigerators , air-conditioning , we can fully modern materials to manufacture and so many things .
we are so in a wonderful situation with electricity in the wealthy world .
but , if we the price down -- let 's the price in half -- we meet in a roadblock , and this was created based on with carbon locked together .
co2 is the planet and the equation for carbon dioxide 's actually very clear .

now , the exact number of connection between a <unk> and the it was resulting <unk> and where they have more drastic consequences are , there 's some of them grapple , but not a lot .
and there 's safe obscurity , it , how bad those consequences will . but they 're deeply unhappy being .
i have the <unk> more than once asked , `` we really need to go down on the near zero to come ?
no good and half or a neighborhood ? ''
the answer is , until we got near zero , is the temperature was going up .
so it 's a big challenge .
it 's very different than to say , we have 3.5 feet high office truck , the under a 10 feet bridge from leadership . the you can then put them from that .
this must be able to settle down , to zero .
now , we run every year , a lot of carbon out , of 26 billion tons .
every american about 20 tons . people of the poor countries , less than one .
on average , it 's about five million tons for everyone on planet .
and somehow we need to bring out that this in zero in space .
it 's been through time .
just different economic potential to have it determines , and we need of <unk> increase the key species go and a wealthy to zero .
this equation , four factors . a little <unk> . they have this thing left -- carbon dioxide -- that they towards zero want to bring and this is used by the number of people depend on , of the service that every man on average use , the average of energy for any service and the co2 , that per unit <unk> will .
so let 's so every single factor of them back and think we , how you go to zero .
probably have one of these numbers very close to zero .
now this is the basic algebra , but let 's it through .
first , we the population .
today lives now 6.8 billion people .
and it is at 9 billion to . the to 9 billion to move .
if we 're very successful with new vaccines , the <unk> and <unk> are we could that i think about 10 percent or 15 percent deflation rate , but over right there is a slope to 1.3 .
the second thing is the services that we use .
that includes all , the food that we eat , clothing and television , heating .
this is very good things and <unk> means , those services are almost any on planet have access to do .
it 's amazing that number up .
in the wealthy world , in the upper half billion , we could be <unk> , and less , but on average is that number , every year up , and , so collectively than double , the number of services , and the per person out there are .
there 's a very basic civil service . there 's home in light , so you the student can read it ?
and these students have n't it , so what they go out and reading their balls whatsoever to <unk> .
now , in efficiency , the e , the energy per service , there are finally good news .
we have something that 's not going up ,
because of different things in <unk> , with other <unk> , through new ways in <unk> , there are many human services , whose amounts of some of those services , by 90 percent down .
in other service , like the making of <unk> , per <unk> -- <unk> <unk> or the <unk> or <unk> , is the flexibilities of improvement , very much smaller .
there , if we feel optimistic is , we may be a reduction in a factor , three or maybe even for a factor of six .
but at the first three factors , we 're now of 26 billion in may <unk> 13 billion tons of the rest . and that does n't come out !
so we 're so the fourth factor of -- and this is a key to be -- it 's sort of co2 , the per unit <unk> will .
it turns out the question , if you that in zero , can .
if you coal , burning , no .
if you natural gas will burn , no .
almost every <unk> for electricity <unk> the co2 , except that renewables , and <unk> .
so , what we were on a global level have to do is , a new paradigm to create .
we need <unk> .
now if i the term `` wonders : we’re running , i mean not the impossible .
the microprocessor is a miracle . the computer is a miracle .
the internet and that diagnostic is a miracle .
the people here have to the development of a lot of miracle that contributed .
usually , there 's not a deadline , you a miracle to a certain kind of date , needs .
usually , you basically just go forward and some , others not .
in this case , we need , but it give and a miracle in very short order to get .
now , i wondered , how can i do this <unk> ?
there 's a natural happening , a demonstration project that the idea of people here to me ?
i think back to the last year , when i mosquitos , and somehow i liked the people that .
the idea was for you really , you know that it people are , the to mosquitos to live .
for energy , i noticed this one .

so here 's a couple of natural or fireflies .
you has told me that they do n't bite . in fact , you will probably wo n't put the glass of punitive sentences .
well , it 's all kinds <unk> like this , but they bring everybody 's not much .

i have the tides , <unk> , the merger and to leave out .
these communities , maybe a moderate savings , and if you better to do when i expect , that would be great , but i mean the core here is that we think about all those five have to work , and we ca n't of them up , because it tells us <unk> , because all have significant problems .
we look at the burning fossil fuels , burning of either of coal or natural gas .
what you have to alert , and you might seem simple , but it does n't . you could have all the co2 , that to churn out of an aerial part comes , layered structure , under pressure <unk> and then some place to capture and hope that there 's left .

if it will make sure ?
who can make a great , which literally a billion times bigger than any kind of waste , to make you of <unk> and other things we can imagine ?
this is a lot of volume .
so that is a tough cracked .
the next thing : <unk> .
and also has three major problems . the cost , especially in <unk> countries are high . the question for certainty that you really feel that does n't go wrong , despite the human voluntary cooperation that the fuel not for weapons that 's used .
and what do you going to waste handled ?
so even he did n't it 's very large , there 's a lot of concerns .
so three very thorny problems that might be solvable , and at that you so we 're going .
the last three of the five , i put together .
there are those renewables , how they often be called .
and they needed -- even loved it is that they do n't make fuel you need -- you have a minuses .
one is the energy that these technologies create dramatic lower than the of <unk> .

and under the vent stalling ,
the sun 's not the whole day , it 's also not every day and it blows the wind will not all .
so you have , if you of these vent sites on is , a way , the energy as in times when they 're not available , to get .
there are so big <unk> . there are challenges in the transmission . if we for saying that it outside of the country is , you do n't just the technology , and they need to the risk around that the energy from where different from .
and there is that <unk> .
and the level to show , i 've all kinds of the batteries , who are made , looking , the for cars , computers , phones , <unk> , for anything . and that i did with the amount of an electrical energy , which the world is , compared . i found that all the batteries , that we now producing , less than 10 minutes of energy , we put itself .
we need so here 's a big medical breakthrough , something that for a factor of 100 vastly better be , as the ways to the time .
this is not impossible , but it 's not easy .
this is , if you 're trying , these <unk> sources of you got 20 percent -- 30 percent of this déclassé consumption of them .
if you want to 100 percent of it was that we want , you have a tremendous show .
now , where should we go , what 's the right approach ?
a `` manhattan project ? how we come to target ?
what we need are many companies , the work at it . hundreds .
in each of five separate enterprises , we need at least 100 people .
for many of you will say , who are crazy ! that 's good .
i think , here in the ted community , there are many ways that , there are affecting them .
bill , has many companies , one is a called <unk> the great <unk> has .
<unk> <unk> invest in dozens of companies , the great things , and interesting ways , and i try this to support .
nathan myhrvold and i was funded a company that , may surprise , the nuclear -- the way around .

so this has in this industry of time off , so it 's no big surprise that a good ideas around .
this <unk> means that you instead of a part of uranium , the one percent , that <unk> , we decided that 99 percent of burning , that <unk> .
it 's quite a crazy idea .
but actually nobody had about how long been considered , but you could never about quantum computers , whether it would work , but since it 's ambitious supercomputer , you do you simulate and see that : aye . with the right <unk> , it looks like this is that there <unk> .
and because you that 99 percent of you burn , is that <unk> very much better .
indeed you burn it 's the garbage , and you can even the waste of the present them as <unk> use .
instead , about the head to break , burn it easy . a great thing .
the low-enriched uranium is being incremental and then , a little bit like a light .
you see that it sort of a column , as a `` traveling the wave of an era of .
that will make sure that <unk> .
here 's a picture of one of in kentucky .
this is the waste , the 99 percent . you have the of this that today is burned , <unk> so there 's <unk> uranium .

and if you <unk> cheap and just <unk> , you get plenty of course , for the rest of lifetime of the planet .
you know , there 's still many challenges , but it 's an example of many hundreds of concepts that we need to move forward to come .
think we , how we do our success rate of is .
how should we have a testament to look like ?
now , we go to the goal , that we do need and then we 're talking about the <unk> .
many are talking about an 80 percent reduction , until 2050 .
it 's really important that we 're going to get .
the rest of 20 percent are in the poorest countries to be created , and still a farm . hopefully will <unk> and cement , until then clean .
so , about these 80 percent of , have the world , including these countries like china , their <unk> completely change .
the other note she says , whether we as in technology , in fact , if you in all the developed countries used , and we on the way , they came to be going to get .
that 's great deal .
this is one key that <unk> .
if we from there back , how do that by 2020 as testament to look like ?
there was going to the two elements of them .
we should the <unk> use , about 25 percent reduction in the way to take out . the less we <unk> , less than is the <unk> be , and we can also the temperature .
but actually is this note for the things that we do that did n't fully to the big , <unk> , just right , or even slightly less important as the other , which the rapidity of innovation for these major breakthroughs in particular .
these major breakthroughs , we need to it up and that we can measure , in <unk> , in <unk> and <unk> .
there are many great ideas to this topic .
that al gore book `` we have the choice . '' and david <unk> `` <unk> energy <unk> the corn , the air . ''
they make it really through and create a framework , where this broad the last can be , because we need to support of all sides .
there 's a few things that comes together to .
this is a wish .
a very much more wish that we did this technology making up .
if you me just a wish for the next 50 years , , i could the president to choose , a vaccine that , and that i love , or i could this desire to vote , the question is , <unk> <unk> without losing co2 being reinvented . this desire , i .
this has the biggest impact .
if we have this desire to do n't get them , the waves , between the long and have folks who 's mortifying , between the united states and china , between the poor and rich countries . and almost all live in this biosphere 2 billion are very much worse .
what we need to do ?
for which measures <unk> i mean ?
we need for more for technology .
if countries , in places like <unk> meet , you should not just about carbon to talk .
they should those <unk> to go and they were horrified , of the ridiculous , low ' monies that for those highly innovative ways to spend a website .
we need <unk> , carbon taxes , <unk> & trade something that a <unk> .
we need to spread the message .
we have a dialogue rational and the entire , and also the things that of the government to be done .
it is a wish , but i think , we can see him to be happy .
thank you .
thank you .
thank you . thanks !
thank you . just about <unk> something better to understand -- first , you get us an idea of the scale that investment be ?
bill gates : the simulation in a supercomputer to do , all the great scientist to get , what we 've done , we need some 10 million . and even if we our materials in a russian nuclear reactor test , to ensure that it could work , you only in the <unk> million .
the tricky step is the building of the first doing , another billion to find that <unk> and the place of in the first of building .
once the first job done is , when he that 's like i promised , then everything is very clearly , because the economy , the energy is so different than at <unk> , how we know it .
and really understand : that means a deep in the ground to build a little bit like a vertical pillar of nuclear <unk> , this towards the uranium and then begin in the process goes up , and working to further down to ?
bg : right . now you have the reactor 's always be coming into , so there are many people and many controls , the wrong can go . this thing where you make it opens and things <unk> or this . that 's not good .
but when you very cheap fuel , you can tell him for 60 years into your -- i think about a column -- that they bury them , without all the complexities .
and it 's sitting there , and they burn down 60 years and then it 's done .
a nuclear reactor , the self , a solution for the garbage is .
bg : yeah . now , what do with the garbage is : you can be able to sit down -- there are much less junk shot with this method -- then take it and grab him in the next reactor and burn it on .
and we start , if we the garbage can take that would have already exists , the inside these <unk> or <unk> at the reactor is . this is our <unk> .
so this is , which for these reactors run a problem was that , what we in our gallery and this is that <unk> dramatically reduce that during this process .
but while you with a different people , this world of these choices we 've talked ,
where it 's the interest , so what really work ?
bg : well , we 've had not on a place , organized and it 's a lot more interesting <unk> for all the `` nuclear '' in the name is . there are big interest and the people of the company was in russia , india , china -- i was here , the energy minister of them , and talked about , like this to <unk> fit .
i 'm optimistic . you know , the french and japanese who have something in the direction .
this is one another one thing that was done .
this is a crucial step forward , but it 's like a faster the reactor and some countries have this built , that is what everybody , the a rapid onset of them , a <unk> for our first .
in your imagination , time and the probability that really the life to call ?
bg : well , we need one of <unk> , <unk> things that they 're very , we secured 20 years to innovate and then 20 years to the beginning .
this is basically the deadline , the us the <unk> has that we write contracts to .
and , you know , <unk> , if all seems to is , and that 's a wish , it could easily give them .
and fortunately , it today , dozens of companies , and we needed hundreds of that , as well , when their new approaches worked , the funding for its operator , for <unk> can .
and it 's the best , if it 's a couple of creating , because then you could a mixture of use .
in any case , we need a solution .
review of the large variety of major breakthroughs , that could see that you know ?
bg : a <unk> is the most important .
that it would be without the <unk> been , but that makes it so much more important .
in a nuclear sector , there are some innovative companies .
you know , we know the work not as well this , but there 's the losing my favorite way that 's a different approach .
there 's a fluid <unk> , which one of difficult and you think , but maybe they say that about us .
and there are different , but this nice thing is that a <unk> a million times , so much energy , like a , we say , a <unk> and so , if you with the problems can get around and they are mainly the radiation , the footprint , and the cost , plays the potential , so the impact on the country and other things , almost in a kind of a league table .
if it does n't , then what ?
we need <unk> have to try , the degrees ' stable enough to hold ?
bg : if you in this situation , it 's as if you ate too much , and shortly before a heart is . what do you then ? you must be a <unk> or that .
there 's a <unk> the to <unk> is that , with various techniques of different to the warming continues to delay , so we 20 or 30 years more than having to <unk> .
this is just a <unk> .
we hope , that we were n't need .
some people say , you should n't on the insurance to work , because you do that might be lazy , so you 're going to eat , because you know that one of the <unk> save them .
i do n't know that smart , if you to the importance of this problem of eyes out , but there are now a larger discourse in <unk> about , whether it available to have to be , if the things faster , or this innovation longer need , when we expect .
climate change , you have one or two things for the , you may have to convince them ?
bg : well , unfortunately , the skeptics in very different <unk> .
the ones , the scientific data points , are very little .
they say that this negative impact is that with the clouds to do , the things are shifting ?
there are very , very few things that you ever say , of which it 's an opportunity in a million people are .
this <unk> here 's like with aids .
you do is the mistake now , and you pay for much later .
and this is the idea , now , if you all kinds of the compelling problems , in something to invest , from what you know , and later , which has -- and there is that the investment is not that 's clear . it 's in the report did n't necessarily the worst possibility and there are people in the wealthy world , the to climate at and say , okay , that 's no big three-dimensional drama .
the fact is that uncertainty of us are able to do .
but my dream lived there is that , if you have economic can do , the co2 was eliminated , then also say the skeptics , `` okay , i 'm not that it 's no carbon <unk> , i wish i almost that it 's the bad , but i 'm going to accept , because it 's cheaper than the previous one way . ''
and that would your answer to the <unk> up the argument that , if you all those same time and energy use to the co2 problem to solve , all the other goals to have suffered , the <unk> , the fight against malaria and so on that it 's a stupid waste of resources , money to invest , as it better stuff is that we can do .
bg : well , the actual amount of the research -- if you got the u.s. is 10 billion per year to spend when they 're doing today -- that 's not so dramatically .
it should be other things not suffer .
it 's going to big <unk> , and they receive a common-sense definition of people disagree , if you something , that 's not as economically , and tried , that to finance . for me that 's happening here the most of waste .
it 's because , you is very shortly before a <unk> and financed by just the learning . i think we should be more things to try that the potential , very much cheaper to be .
if the <unk> , the you get , a very high <unk> is , then you can only the rich with it .
i mean , each of us here , five times as much for our energy on without his lifestyle to change .
for the bottom two billion , but it 's a disaster .
and myself up , you think about .
his new <unk> is now , `` why is the research that 's really needs ? ''
he 's still , because of those stories , with the <unk> , , but he understood that a very rare group , and bring it now that <unk> .
and this is a methodical step , the i for them appropriately , .
the research , it 's just nuts , how little the aid becomes .
bill , i think i speak for almost any people here , when i say , i 'm really that their desire , right is . many , you .
bg : thanks .
some years ago , here at ted , which was taken peter <unk> a <unk> called `` the <unk> '' before .
the idea is quite simple . <unk> need to achieve the spiraling structure with 20 <unk> , i think about . tall with tape , i think about . tall string and a marshmallow ; building .
the marshmallow ; you have on top .
and , although it really just seems that this is actually really though , because it 's people who is very quickly work together .
and so i thought that this is an interesting idea is , and i have this in a <unk> menu .
it was a huge success .
since i 've heard about 70 workshops and the world -- 2001 , with students , developers and architects , even with <unk> the <unk> and there 's something about this task , which comes down some insights into how the research that we enabled and i want some of them to share .
usually the most people to themselves into the task to orient .
you talk about , you think , how it will look like , they wrestle in power ,

they invest in a lot of their time to build all <unk> structures
and finally , just before they of time , take someone the marshmallow and they put it carefully at the top , we step one step back and `` <unk> . '' admire them their work .
what but then , almost always , is that `` <unk> '' to a <unk> '' is , because that weight of the marshmallow , that does that the whole thing to actually curls and <unk> .
there 's a number of people that much more , `` <unk> '' <unk> have to other , and the worst , fresh <unk> .
they 're lying , they 're cheating , they are confused and make really <unk> structure .
and of there 's too expensive teams who are much more , `` <unk> '' <unk> , and the best people are the freshness of alumni of this .
and this is quite astounding .
like us , peter to tell you could make it 's not just the highest towers , but also the most interesting structures of all .
what you might wonder , is : how is that ? why ? what about whom ?
and peter 's told , `` none of children spend time in the head of <unk> <unk> to be .
they do n't go into <unk> .
but there 's another reason .
and that is that mba students that has been , the a real original plan to find , ok !
and it and then to realize .
now what happens , if you the marshmallow were on the peak inside , they have of time and what happened ?
it 's a crisis .
sound familiar , what ?
what kindergarten do differently -- is , they do with the marshmallow and start and prototypes to build , we did a prototyping , always with the marshmallow for the top , so that you once the ability to have dilapidated prototypes to fix .
constructionists recognize this kind of collaboration as a core of <unk> the way .
and with every attempt to get the children of feedback , which works and what do n't .
this is the performance , using prototypes to work , far -- but we see again , how different teams to do .
the average for the most 's around about . <unk> , students make half as , lawyer , something more , but not much , kindergarten kids are better than the adults .
who is the most successful ?
architects and engineers , to happiness .
tall is the ultimate , what i 've seen .
and why ? because they are triangles , understanding and <unk> geometric patterns are the key to make stable structures to build .
and ceo 's something about the average . but here is it 's interesting .
i 'll show you an executive administrator at the team , they become significantly better .
it 's unbelievable . you see and began to see , `` this team is going to win . ''
you can the predictions . why does it ?
because they 're special faculties the <unk> have .
they pass the process , they understand him .
and that team that weight , and on the work to pay attention is the performance of teams who are significant improvement .

if you into teams , the classic ali , maybe , you ca : six , the robust to have .
i did well , something interesting .
i thought , we take the <unk> same .
so that provided me a $ 10,000 dollars cash prize to software for the winner .
what you think happened with these <unk> ?
what was the outcome ?
this happened . not a team had a working on the structure .
if anyone cares about a <unk> of construction , built right , he had the price at the globe .
so it 's not interesting is that high <unk> a powerful cooling effect have ?
we reenacted this exercise with our students .
what you think happened now ?
well understood the advantage of `` <unk> .
so i saw from the same , bad team of the best .
they produced the highest amounts of construction in a single time .
there are so <unk> lessons for us , over the nature of panic and success .
you might ask : why would somebody in order to invest in a <unk> to go ahead ?
the reason is , i 'll help digital tools and processes that , to multidisciplinary teams to help , cars , video games and `` <unk> <unk> '' to make .
and what the <unk> does is , it helps them is , accepting enough to identify .
because , frankly , each project has its own marshmallow .

and this is the value of me , this is so easy task .
and those of them , which there are interested , <unk> go .
it 's a blog , where you see , how to the marshmallow is building .
there 's a <unk> there .
they find a crazy examples of the world , how people , the system stats and <unk> .
there 's also <unk> .
and the <unk> lesson , i think is that construction in a <unk> sports is .
it requires that we all our senses at the problem , and that we think that can use , like our feelings and we do , in the challenge , the front of us is .
and sometimes it 's a small prototype of all , you need to us from a `` <unk> '' -- to a <unk> '' moment to take out .
and that can make a big difference do .
thank you .
we do such as if we have this one machine ,
a big machine , a cool , <unk> machine , and this is a time .
and everybody in this room have in .
and they can go into the past , you can into the future to go ; they can not in here and remain ,
and i wonder , what they choose , because i my friends in a lot lately asked this question , and they wanted to everyone in the past , go .
i do n't know . they wanted to a time ago , before it 's car , or twitter or `` america is the american idol '' .
i do n't know .
i 'm convinced that you kind of the sort of nostalgia , of wishful thinking that is .
and that i do .
i 'm not part of this group , i must say .
i do n't want to the past , and that 's not , because i was a , adventurers , i am .
it 's because that options on this planet does n't go back , you go ahead .
so i want to this machine , and i want to the future go .
this is the greatest time , and depending on this planet , however , which gives you , which is : health , wealth , and mobility , the opportunities , at declining <unk> .
there was never before a time , like this .
my <unk> died of all when she turned 60 percent by .
my grandparents urged her this number on 70 .
my parents are the 80 in the into iraq .
there was so much better a nine the beginning of my <unk> stand .
but it 's not just about people like us , because this is a bigger one thing as it .
a kid , that today in new delhi , born , you can expect , so long to live as the richest man in the world a hundred years .
think about it . that 's an amazing fact .
and why is that ?
the smallpox . the smallpox , billion people on this planet killed .
they have the demographics of the ground in a way to be shaped , how it 's no war has ever has managed to .
they are out . they are gone .
we have you <unk> . pfft .
in the wealthy world are diseases , the millions of us to just one generation , threatened , not yet .
<unk> , <unk> , <unk> ...
i know anything yet , someone , what it is ?
vaccines , modern medicine , our ability , billion people to feed , this is that successes the scientific method .
and in my view is the scientific method , things out , look , if it works , there are changing , if it 's not doing , one of the great achievement of man .
so that is the good news .
unfortunately , that 's been doing all the good news , because it 's some other problems , and they were often brought up ,
and one of this is that despite all of our external résumé , a billion people in the world every day ; to go down on .
this number up , and she goes up very quickly , and that 's embarrassing .
and not only that , we have our ability to be used , this world , to devastate .
water , <unk> country , rainforest , oil , gas , they disappear , which is pretty soon , and if we 're not from this chaos <unk> disappear , we also .
the question is so , we can do ? i think it .
i think it 's clear that we food production , the billion people feed , without the country , on her life , to <unk> .
i think , we can this world with energy supply that they do n't look at the parks .
i think that really , and no , that 's not thinking .
but this keeps me to wake up -- one of the things that me to wake me stop . we have scientific advance who 's never been so essential to me almost like now , never ,
and we were also never able to , it 's reasonable <unk> , like us , it today can .
we 're going to the cusp of amazing , astonishing design events in many places . and yet , i think it was something that we are hundreds , 300 years ago , the subjects to go back after we have to get a time to find , where we progress that 's fighting , where we about these things from massive <unk> , to be more and then when now .
now , the front covers , in their faith , which is so closely , it was not free her cubicle .
do n't even the truth will they free .
and you hear , everybody has quite a on their opinion ; even a right on their opinion , for progress ,
but you know , what they were no 're right ?
they have no right on their own facts . <unk> , you do n't .
and i have a while being , and figure out .
about a decade , i have an article about , like for `` the new yorker , '' written , a small paper .
and i was amazed , in opposition to collide , on the resistance towards the , what the end of the most activity in health in history of man is .
i did n't know , what i should do , so i did n't know what i always do , i wrote an article and continued .
and soon after that i wrote an article about genetically of food .
the same story , only bigger .
the people were getting crazy .
so i 've also about an article written , and i could n't understand what 's the people thought , that would `` <unk> '' , why they believed that molecules on a certain type of a random way around a <unk> on the area of nature was .
but you know , i do what i do . i wrote this paper , i did on .
i mean , i am foremost journalist ,
we have to type , we can take a , we go food , that 's okay .
but these articles and they took me , and i could n't figure out , why , and eventually i found out .
and that 's because that these <unk> , the me nuts were actually ca n't <unk> were .
that were prudent people , educated people , a decent people .
they were just like the people in this room .
and i was so awful mess .
but then i thought , you know what that 's be honest .
we 're at some point , at that we 're not that 's in relation to advance , how early .
we 're <unk> of them .
we 're ironic that , with small , so , `` no progress .
okay , that there 's reasons , and i think we know , which causes these are .
we have this faith in the institutions , in the authority , and sometimes in the science to be lost , and it 's no reason why that 's not so to be .
you can just a couple of the name is , and people will understand .
chernobyl , <unk> , the <unk> , <unk> , mass destruction , the <unk> 2000 .
i mean , you know , you can your list your vote .
there are questions and problems with the people , of which we believed that they always right before . so be skeptical .
imagine you ask , for me the evidence , an urge you some evidence .
you take nothing for granted .
but you get ready , if you evidence to get you have this evidence of view , and it 's not good .
and i can do from the reason to say that we now in an epidemic of fear for life , like i 've never seen , and hopefully much never see me .
about 12 , i was a story on the world , a horrific story that the <unk> with the <unk> , <unk> , and <unk> vaccine appeared in complete set .
very scary .
tons of studies have done to see if that was true .
tons of trial should be conducted ; it 's a serious .
the data coming in .
the data coming in from the united states , from england , from sweden , from canada , and they were all the same , none of , no link , no ego .
it does n't matter . it does n't matter , because we have been blown away , we think , what we see , what we to believe , what does that we really feel .
we do n't think about a bunch of documents from a <unk> , the us data is , and i understand that , i think that do we all .
but you know what ?
the result of it was devastating ,
a little bit about this fact , the u.s. is one of the only countries in the world , where the immunization rate of <unk> rate .
this is a massive and we should be ashamed .
it 's terrible .
what happened , that we could do .
now , i understand that . that i 'm doing .
because it has anybody here <unk> ?
has one in the audience ever get one of <unk> to see ?
it 's not many times .
what happens in this country never arrived , but the 160,000 time in the world in the last year .
that are many deaths from <unk> , 20 per hour .
but because it 's not happening here is , we can it into denial , and people like jenny jenna can run around and decrypting messages of fear and illiteracy around the platforms like watching oprah and larry king live preach it .
and that you can do , because they cause and of not connecting .
they do n't realize that these things going to seem , but almost never the same thing is .
and this is something that we learn to , which is very quickly .
that guy 's a hero , jonas who .
he captivity making us from one of the worst <unk> of man .
not afraid , no moons , <unk> , and phew , gone .
the guy in the middle , not so much .
he is paul <unk> .
he has just with a few other people a <unk> .
he does the lives of <unk> , 500,000 in children per year in the developing to rescue .
pretty well , not ?
well , this is well , except that what paul air , and over the vaccines , speak , and says , how valuable they are , and that people just quit ought to can complain .
and that says he actually so .
paul 's a terrorist .
if paul kemp-robertson walks into a public <unk> talks , it can not having fully armed and watchdogging of evolution .
he 's getting calls home in , because the people to him to tell that you know where his kids going to school .
and why ? paul romer unveils a vaccine that has done .
i do n't need this say , but the vaccines are essential .
you take it continues , but the diseases come back , terrible disease , and this is going on .
we have in this country now <unk> .
and that gets worse , and pretty soon be kids back to die , because it 's just a question of numbers .
and they 're not just to <unk> die .
what about <unk> ? we take this . why not ?
a <unk> of mine sent me a few weeks ' and told you think i 'm a little too loud .
nobody wrote that ever said before .
they would their children did not against <unk> immunized . absolutely not .
subtle .
why ? because we do n't <unk> , and you know what ?
we had in this country had no <unk> .
now , i do n't know , maybe i got this morning , somebody in lagos , a plane and going straight to los angeles , the moment he is about ohio .
and in a few hours before landing he and <unk> a car , and he comes to long beach , and he 's one of <unk> <unk> tonight -- like .
and he does n't know that he 'd be a <unk> to become infected , and we know that it , because that 's the world now time .
this is the planet , on the we live . they do n't so , as if he does this is .
we love , us to lie in front covers . we love this .
you have this morning , all of vitamins had taken ?
<unk> , a little <unk> that you to sit together .
i know , that they 've done , because half the americans , that every day in power .

the data to prove that constantly .
they sheets make their urine . do more you almost never .
that 's okay , they want to 70 million dollars for the dark , urine at the numbers .
i agree with them being able to .
the darker the urine . dark .
why we doing this ? why we doing this ?
now , i think , i 'm sorry -- we hate the pharma industry .
we hate it too strong government . we have n't trust the system .
and that we should not too . our healthcare system is miserable .
it 's cruel to millions of people .
it 's absolutely amazing cold and <unk> they will make us that , it can afford .
we 're so that way , and where do we ?
we walk into the poor of the <unk> .
it 's fine . i love the <unk> .
but you know , it 's a serious business , because this stuff is crap , and we spend 2.5 billion dollars for it out .
and i 've all kinds of artifacts from here .
none of them -- <unk> , , <unk> , , <unk> , because i 'm not time , what this is , but we spend 2.5 billion dollars for it out , it is , .
and you know what ? sometimes i say , scream at the people in and say , `` what does it propels you ? let the folks ai n't do , what they want .
so you feel a good . ''
and you know what ? they 're wrong .
it because i don’t care is , whether it 's health is , who says , `` hmm , i 'm going to the expense of experts getting mammograms have n't suppose '' or any <unk> , of their patient with <unk> treat us wants .
if you look at that way you 're going down , where i think , and magic of evidence and science to replace , get them to a place , at that they do n't want to be .
they get to mean thabo mbeki 's in south africa .
he was set of people around , because he put it was that red <unk> , <unk> and <unk> much more than any antiretroviral drugs are , of which we know that it the course of aids , braking , can .
hundreds <unk> deaths in a country , the worse than any other of this disease <unk> will .
you tell me , not that these things that the consequences has .
they have you . who have the way .
now , the <unk> epidemic , where we are located , is this ridiculous , struggle between the <unk> genetically out food and the <unk> .
this is a <unk> debate . they have to stop .
it 's a debate about the words , over the metaphor .
this is the ideology , not science .
everything that we eat , every <unk> , each branch <unk> , everybody brussels sprouts , from the people changed .
you know , it was no <unk> in the garden .
it was no <unk> .
it was no christmas . we 've got it .
we have it in the last 11,000 years .
and some of that has worked and sometimes not .
we 've got rid of , what doesn’t work has .
now we can it specifically , and of there are risks . but we can kind of vitamin a in rice mill doing , and this stuff can million people , million people , their lives to do .
that does n't you want to do ?
i have to say , that i do n't .
we refuse to genetically of food off .
why we do that ?
now , what i have this song is : too many of chemicals , pesticides , hormones , <unk> , we do n't have huge areas with one thing , it 's wrong .
we do n't want that companies alive to patent .
we do n't want that companies seeds have .
and you know , what my answer to all this is ?
yes , they 're right . fix this , we .
it 's true , we have a huge <unk> , but this is not science .
that has to do nothing to do .
it 's right , moral , <unk> .
you know that the science , not a company is .
it 's no country .
it is less than an idea ; it 's a process .
it 's a process , and sometimes work , he and sometimes not , but the idea that we of science , not allow you should , your work to do , because we fear , is a real end , and she 's millions of people from taking place away .
you know , in the next 50 years we 're 70 percent more than growing food than we have the moment . 70 percent .
this investment in africa in the last 30 years .
embarrassing , shameful .
they need that , and we give you do n't .
and why ? genetically of food .
we want people do n't be empowered , this <unk> stuff to eat , like for example <unk> .
<unk> is something that half a billion people eat .
it 's like a potato .
it 's just a bunch of calories . it 's miserable .
it did n't require nutrients , it 's not a protein , and scientists to build all the men in a .
and then they could have people that food and would be blind be .
they would not going , and you know what ?
that would you . it would n't <unk> <unk> , but it would you .
and everything that i say to do is : how to fight us that ?
i mean , we wonder : how to fight us that ?
because we 're not genes <unk> want ?
it 's not about , they are going around . it 's not about the chemicals .
it 's not about our ridiculous passion for our hormones , our is on the greater our food , better food , unique food .
it 's not to charge <unk> , it 's about , people in life to get , and it 's time again , to understand what that means .
because you know what ?
if we do n't do this , if we so on doing what we do we look at a little bit guilty , at that we , i think , not guilty about trying to be , high-tech colonialism .
it 's no other for that , what happened here .
it 's acting selfish , it 's ugly , it 's our not worthy , and we have to really stop them .
after this amazing kind of entertainment , they want so we might say , you will you still in this ridiculous time and in the future go ? ''
in any case . that i want to any rate .
today , put them in the present , but we have an incredible opportunity .
we can see this time on all imagine , what we want .
we can you 're moving into , where we 're moving into want , and we 're going to move , where we want .
we have these conversations , and we need to think , but if we in the time up , and in the future , we 're happy to be that made to have .
i know that we can , and as it i 'm concerned that 's something that the world needs now .
thank you .
thank you .
for some time i 'm interested in the <unk> . it might seem curious about that 's a magician interested in that , it 's because , you look at it 's what i , as `` a conjurer , the to a real humility , when someone just for sure enough to believe . ''
in other words , <unk> have in some studies conducted a measurable effect is , the <unk> , which is just so , because the person thinks , what to her , is one , so , or a kind of -- in <unk> , for example , there is , if the patient 's basically tightly enough to think , a measurable effect in the body , and the <unk> calls .
a conjurer 's going to a real , because somebody in that are realizing that .
so that we each other thing you understand , i want to tell you a fundamental , very trick them .
and i 'll tell you , how he works . this is a trick , more of the for the 1950s , in any <unk> for children under tension .
i even photographed him from <unk> scout magic of <unk> in the 1970s learned .
i 'm going to him for you do and it and then you explain .
and then i 'll explain , why i 'll tell them .
so , you see , what happens .
that knife , that they 're able ; my hand , and they 're able to .
i 'm going to the knife . just so in my hand , .
i patent my sleeve , back .
and to ensure that nothing in my sleeve , go away , or from him out , i 'm going to my wrist , right here <unk> .
this way you can see that 's not at any time goes on your nostril . as i here <unk> , can not in my sleeve , and gather or paint it .
and the goal is very simple .
i 'm going to my hand up , and hopefully , if everything goes well , is that knife by my very , magnetics title .
it is actually so on its place that i said it raises , without that knife falls off .
nothing goes into my sleeve , it comes out , no <unk> . and you can all at .
<unk> !

probably know many of them in the room that trick .
he works :
i think that knife in the hand .
i 'm saying that i my wrist <unk> , to ensure that nothing in my sleeve , go away , or out , and this is a lie .
the reason , why i my wrist <unk> , he is that in the real secret of the illusion is .
in the moment , where i mean by hand of you <unk> so that they release of the back to see , now , this shot here , my thumb , just from there , where it was , in a position , where he 'd like , sprawled like this is .
wonderful trick ?
there , which is someone who does not a childhood had .
so , he 's here . right .
and when i <unk> , changing the finger and its position .
and now you could talk about why that a conjurer is , why you 're not realizing that down here 's just three fingers to see are , because the mind and the way that he information together , they 're not able to count , one , two , three , but it as a group does .
but this is it now here n't actually , and then i open my hand .
of course , there alien watching , but not by the magnetics my body , but through a trick , through my thumb , the right now there is .
and when i mean by hand , that happens to happen , so i <unk> , through this movement from view that the finger to <unk> .
i 'll use these hand away . and there is the knife .
this trick , you can your friends and neighbor who works . thanks .
now , what has this with the <unk> to do ?
a year or so , i read a study that i really , my world has .
i 'm not a doctor or explorers , and that was that for me an amazing thing .
so it is what turned out , if you a <unk> in form of a white to climb onto their neighborhoods , in the shape of a <unk> , is that just a round , white pill , the one particular type of measurable effect that has .

and the fact that none of any , so ... it is just <unk> .
but a white men are probably is not as well , a blue pill .
what ? it caused me really out .
it turns out , but it out that 's not everything is .
if you capsules that will , are the more effective than the pills and every form .
a single colored the capsule that looked at some of the yellow and the red is that 's better than a white capsule .
and the <unk> plays a role .
there are probably twice a day is not as well , these pills -- i 'm now , not at the exact , remember . i 'm sorry .
the key , but is , ...
... that the doses of play a role .
and the shape is a role .
and if you the ultimate <unk> have to , you have to the needle in your grasp .

this is a very powerful image in the head . that 's very much stronger than a white pill .
this graph is really -- i 'm going to you in a different times show , if we have a projector , .
the fact , so this is that the white men are probably not so good looks like the blue pill , not that good looks like a cramped capsule that 's not so good looks like the needle .
and none of it has some really , so peculiar property . it 's only our faith in fact , the inside us a stronger and effect of the results .
i wanted to know that i did this idea for a magic trick could play .
i 'll do something that obviously a conjurer is , and i leave it really look .
we know , from the study that you to the needle in your leadership , if it on the thing going to .
this is an 18th camel in long <unk> . it 's very , <unk> . and i 'm going to you start with a little bit of sterile .
this is really piqued my second nature . it 's not <unk> special <unk> meat .
this is my skin . this is not <unk> from hollywood .
i 'll discuss this needle in my skin and bite out of them into a kind of us , until you on the other hand , hats .
if you the culprit is -- if they easily in order collapsing fall -- that i 've got a few friends , the last night in the room , and this year , and some people that i did n't know , and it 's a woman , so suffocated .
i 'm so , if you very well , and then you looking for the next 30 seconds away . or , you know what , i 'm going to the first <unk> piece here back to do .
it can see in , you can but also <unk> , if you want .
so , it 's so , right here , where my second nature of start , the bottom part of my <unk> i 'll just a single puncture , do .
i 'm really sorry . it 's this crazy ?
and now , just a little bit through my skin and on the other side of way back out .
now we 're actually in the same condition that we do the <unk> had .
about .
but now you can be my fingers do n't count , right ?
so , i 'm going to show you . this is one , two , three , four , five .
well ,
i know what that people think , if you see .
they say , `` okay , who 's certainly not so stupid and <unk> to the skin , just about us a few minutes long to communicate . ''
now , then i 'll show you .
how does it from here ? pretty good .
yes , i know .
and people back to say , `` okay . i have that do n't seen . ''
the people in the <unk> come here in .
so let it me give you from the closeness to show .
it 's my skin . this is not <unk> from hollywood .
this is my meat , and i can do <unk> .
i 'm sorry . if you the culprit is , you take away , you look not going anywhere .
and get back or the that the late at some sort of video , we 're going to say , `` well , this is fairly impressive , but if it really is , he would -- you see , here 's a hole and there , if it really , which is , it would sexual intercourse . ''
okay , let me a little blood for you <unk> .
yes , it there .
normally would i now the needle out .
i would my arm oil and you show that there wo n't find lesions are .
but i think , in this picture here and with the intention , from a delusion is a real to do , i 'm the needle . just in there , and so from the stage to go .
we 're in the next days of a time to face .
i hope that you get a sense that . thank you .
everybody talks about today about that happiness .
i have some people the number of books are , the with `` <unk> '' in the headline in the last five years on the world , and they gave after about 40 up , and there was a lot more .
there 's a massive wave of interest in luck , the explorers .
there are very much <unk> .
everybody would like the people happy to do .
but despite all of tide of work , there are several different cognitive biases can think that it sort of almost impossible to do , clear about happiness thinking .
and my talk today is mainly from these cognitive , were doing .
this is for layman , the of their own happiness might think , and it 's for scientists , the about happiness might think , because it turns out that we just as confused , are like everybody else .
the first of land is a <unk> , complexity of admit that .
it turns out that word that fortunate to do n't put a useful to throw it more importantly , because we do it up too many different things work .
i think , there 's a particular meaning , on the we put this story might , but in a big and all this is something that we give up to this , and so we will to a way to think it would have to that , and well-being is .
the second case is a really confuses the experience and memory , basically consists of them required to be happy in his life and be happy about his life or happy with his life .
and these are two very different ideas , and they 're both <unk> in the idea from happiness .
and the third is the <unk> , and this is the <unk> fact that we 're not talking about a situation that think , the well-being is , without its significance to contaminate .
i mean , this is a real , cognitive and trap .
there is simply no way , it right to get .
now i 'd like with an example start by someone , that one <unk> had to one of my lectures that 's a story here . [ unclear ... '' he said , he had a symphony , and it was absolutely beautiful music , and all the end of tape there was a <unk> <unk> sound .
and then put it uses x-rays , really quite an emotionally , that 's the whole experience ever ruined .
but that i did n't it .
what it ruined had been the memories in the experience .
he had the experience them anyway .
he had 20 minutes <unk> music had .

what we do this is that we come over and over the other people think we might be in terms of two types of self .
there 's a <unk> myself , that in the present to live and the present , if you know , is able , the past , back to experience , but basically just the presence has .
it 's the <unk> myself , that the doctor <unk> -- you know , if the doctor says , `` i 'm now it hurts , when i do you here <unk> ? ''
and then there 's a <unk> myself , and that <unk> itself is this , <unk> and the story of our lives upright , and it 's one that the doctor to address that by looking at the question is : `` how do you have to recently , that feel ? ''
or `` what was their journey to albania ? '' or whatever .
these are two very different entities that <unk> ourselves and that <unk> myself , and the two to do is part of <unk> of <unk> from happiness .
so , that <unk> itself is a storyteller .
and that is really a learning basic reaction to our memories of -- it begins immediately .
we tell you 're not just a story , if we started to do , stories to tell .
our memory someone tells us stories , that is , what we of our artificial but do n't plan is a story .
and let <unk> with an example start .
it 's an old one study .
it 's real patients that 's a painful procedure , .
i 'm not going into it go . you today is not more painful , but she was painful , as this study in the 1990s was going down .
they were asked , everybody loses 60 seconds about their pain to report .
and here are two patients . that 's your records .
and they 're asking : `` who made by both have more suffered ? ''
and that 's a very simple question .
patient to b 's definitely more suffered . his <unk> was no longer , and every minute of pain , the patient is a , had had a patient to b , and more .
but now there 's a different question : `` how much i think these patients that they do with ? ''
and here 's a surprise .
and the surprise is that patient is a , a lot <unk> <unk> at the <unk> had a patient to b .
the stories of <unk> were different , and having a very big part of the story is , how it ends .
and none of these stories is very <unk> or a great -- but one of them is this shows ...
but one of them is substantially worse than the other .
and the , the worse is was the , where the pain of the end on its zenith , . it 's a bad history .
where we know that ?
because we all these people for their <unk> asked , and pretty much later , `` how much was the whole thing to be ? `` well ,
and she was much worse for a , as to b in the <unk> .
well , this is a direct fight between the <unk> ourselves and the <unk> itself .
from view of <unk> even had to b is a <unk> time .
now , what you with the patient is a , you could do , and we have in clinical experiments done , and it 's been made , and it works , you could actually the <unk> of the patient is a to give them , you just the tube in it 's not too much about him to rolling .
this is going to take that the patient is suffering , but only a little and much less than before .
and if you that a few minutes long makes you have to that <unk> ourselves from the patient is a worse off , and you have to that <unk> ourselves from the patient is a lot better off , because now , you about on a , a story about his experience .
which is a story from ?
and this is for the stories that the memory of us to this and it 's the stories that we invent .
so superior to a story <unk> are <unk> , a significant , have and ends .
and break are very , very important , and in this case <unk> the end .
so , that <unk> own lives on his life changing .
it 's have of <unk> , one after the other .
and they say , what happens with these moments ?
and the answer is really simple . they 're be lost forever .
i mean , the most , have our lives -- and i have this happened -- you know , the psychological present is true than about three seconds long . which means , you know that it 's in a life about 600 million of it 's . in a month there 's about 600,000 , the most of you leave to have no .
the most of you 're completely ignored by the <unk> itself .
and yet , you get stuck in the sense that they count of is that what during this , have of <unk> is our lives is .
it 's the limited resource that we use as we 're in the world are .
and it , they would seem to be important , but this is not the story that the <unk> ourselves to we keep .
so we do this <unk> ourselves and that <unk> myself , and they 're really quite different .
the biggest difference between them is the interacting with the time .
from view of <unk> myself , if you a fancy vacations , and the second one week that 's good as the first , it 's <unk> spend twice as well as the <unk> vacation .
so that 's not at for the <unk> itself .
for the <unk> itself is a <unk> spend much better than the <unk> vacations , because there is no new memories , which will .
they have a story does n't changed .
and this way is time in the edge of variable that a <unk> itself is a <unk> itself . time , very much impact on this story .
so , that <unk> itself is more , as to remember , and stories to tell .
it 's actually the one that decision making , because if you a patient , the , if you got two <unk> at two different surgeons had and to decide , which he would choose to , it 's , the votes in fact , the memory , the less bad , and this is the surgeon , the winner selected will .
this <unk> itself has no voice in this choice .
actually we choose not between those moments . we choose between the memories of experiences .
and even if we got to the future thinking , we think about our future is n't usually when experiences .
we think about our future for as <unk> memories .
and what the can you look , you know , a way that tyranny of <unk> myself , and they do that <unk> even think more than one that kind of the <unk> even a 400-pound electroencephalogram through experience that the <unk> does n't need .
i have the sense that if we started going to do that a lot of the case , that means we make a vacation largely the bottle of <unk> itself .
and this is a little hard to justify so , i think .
i mean , how much i 'd we of our memories ?
this is one of explanations that for the dominance of <unk> even gave it will .
and when i think about , i think about a fancy vacations , it 's a few years in antarctica 've done , who clearly the best vacations , the i ever had , and i think quite often it in relation to , how often i to others , the hdtv , i think .
and i 've probably about my memory of these <unk> journey , i 'd say about 25 minutes long in the last four years <unk> .
now , when i 've seen the folder , open , you have to 600 , and i would have another one hour spent .
so , that are three weeks , and that are other than half hours .
because it seems to the disagreement , to give .
now , i like a little extreme to be , you know , it , like your appetite , i on the 'd of memories , but myself , if you more of doing there 's a real question . why we spend their memories so much weight in <unk> to the weight , that we of the be ?
so i want that you about an experiment to think .
imagine your next to ago , you know that the end of <unk> all their own images being gutted , and they get a <unk> drug , so that you do n't remember that will .
now , they would the same to vote ?
and if you a different to vote , there 's a conflict between her two types of self , and they have to think about , as you this conflict over and it 's not at obviously , because if you in terms of time thinking , you get an answer . and if you in terms of memories is you could you another answer to get .
why we the hdtv , these things that we choose a problem that comes to us turns out with a choice between the two types of self .
now , the two types of self , so , if two words from fortune on .
there 's actually two concepts of happiness that we can use , one per second self .
so they can ask : how excited is that <unk> ourselves ?
and then they would say , how are happy to have in life of <unk> ourselves ?
and they 're all -- lucky to have is a fairly complicated process .
what are the emotions , the measured it can be ?
and , incidentally , we 're going to do a pretty good idea to get from fortune of <unk> ourselves over the time .
if you after the luck of <unk> yourself questions , it 's a very different thing .
this is not talking about , as happy one person who lives .
it 's about , as happy or enjoy the person is , if this person about their lives of it .
very different conception .
everybody , of those terms of language is the study of happiness vibrations , and i belong to a lot of explorers of well-being , the study of happiness has been up , in fact , the way .
the distinction between the luck of <unk> ourselves and the average of <unk> itself is in recent years is given birth , and now going to achieve that got x-ray to measure .
the <unk> foot 's a global survey , at the more than a half million people were asking a drug runners are about that you about her life thinking and about their experiences . and there was another group effort into the direction .
in recent years , so we 've begun , over the privilege of the two types of self to learn .
and the one being such thing that we , i think , we 've learned is that they really different they are .
you can know , as happy somebody with his life is , and that teaches you really not much about , how excited he compartmentalizes his life living and vice versa .
just to show you an idea of the correlation of to do that correlation of is about <unk> .
what that means is that if you know someone would meet and you would tell you , oh , his father 's a <unk> , how much would you about its scale know ?
now , it would just over its scale know , but there 's much uncertainty .
they have so much uncertainty .
if i tell them that somebody would be life than eight on a scale from 10 <unk> , you have much uncertainty about , how excited he 's with his <unk> itself .
the correlation of is so low .
we know something about that the average of <unk> value .
we know that money is very important , goals are very important .
we know that happiness , basically means , very pleased to be with people that we like , time to spend with people that we like .
there are other occupational pleasure , but this is a dominant .
so if you that happiness , the two types of self to maximize that we want you will look at the very different things do .
the implication of anyway , what i 've said this is that we 're lucky to do n't possibly be as a substitute for well-being .
it 's a completely different conception .
now , very quickly , one another reason , from that we had no idea of happiness to think , this is that we 're not on the same things as if you over the life thinking , and if we actually life .
so if you the question to imagine , how excited the people in california are you will not the correct response to get .
if you that question , imagine you think that the people in california to be happier , if you , we say , in ohio gave life .
and what happens is that if you about that live in california , you think you think about the difference in california , and other places , and this difference is , we say , in the climate .
well , it turns out that painless climate is not very important for the <unk> itself is , and it 's not even very important for the thoughtful , that will decide , as happy people are .
now , because the thoughtful about yourself responsible , she ended up -- some people might the end to california .
and it 's interesting to track , what happens with people that to california , in hopes , especially happy to be .
now , you <unk> themselves will not happy to be .
we know that .
but one thing will happen . they 're going to think that you happier , because if you think about you will be remembered it will , how awful the weather in ohio , . and they 're going to feel that it is the right decision point , .
it 's very difficult , clear about well-being of thinking , and i hope , i have you an idea of transcendence , how hard it 's .
thank you .
thank you . i have a question for them .
thank you .
now , when we a few weeks on the phone , you saw them towards me that it 's a pretty interesting thing was that , from this <unk> taken up .
this is something , what 's part of , let , because they now a few minutes left have ?
daniel <unk> : sure .
i think , the most interesting thing that we 're in <unk> survey found , is a number that we absolutely not to find expecting had .
we found that in terms of the luck of <unk> itself .
if we look , like emotion to get contact .
and it turns out that by an income of 60,000 dollars a year , for americans , and this is a fantastic idea of americans , about 600,000 , but it 's a representative fantastic idea , under one of income comes about 600,000 dollars a year .
60,000 years .
dk : 60 .
60,000 dollars a year are the people getting unhappy , and they 're increasingly less happy , i 've grown , they 're going .
that we get a completely flat line .
i mean , i 've ever so flat line seen .
what happens , is obvious that money you wo n't <unk> , right , but that lack of money one certainly the distress , right , and we can this great non-articulated agony , you measure .
in terms of the other self , of <unk> myself , you get another story .
ever more money you earn more satisfied , you .
this is not in emotions .
but danny , in the entire american pursuit , it 's about life , freedom , the quest for happiness .
when people this evidence to take seriously , i mean , it 's all the head to imagine , everything that we think , for example , in terms tax policy and so forth .
there 's a chance that politicians that the country , generally a finding out how to take seriously , and based on politics , will do ?
dk : you know , i believe that it recognition is for the role <unk> in politics .
the recognition is slow to be in the united states , no question , but in the united kingdom is that you just and in other countries which is where you use .
the people are nearby , acknowledge that it in luck to think should , if you about politics , thinking .
it will be a while , and people will discuss them , if you <unk> explore , or whether they <unk> explore want , so we have this debate pretty soon being clueless .
how you 're lucky to increase , it 's very differently depending upon it , as you think and if you know about the <unk> even think , or whether it on the <unk> even think .
this is politics are , i think , in the next few years .
in the united states <unk> you , that <unk> the population of measuring .
this is , i think , in the next one or two decades of the national security numbers .
now , it strikes me , this is subject , or should at the most exciting things -- subject to pursue be over the next few years .
thanks for the invention of behavioral economics .
thank you , danny <unk> .
i 'm watching jane mcgonigal , i think of games .
i is now for 10 years games . and my goal for the next decade , it as easy to do , the world in reality to save so , in <unk> to save this is .
i have a design for . i want more people to convince them , including you all , more time to play a bigger and <unk> games to spend .
now we spend three billion hours per week with <unk> .
some of you might think , `` this is a lot of time for games . ''
perhaps a lot of time , when you think about how many problems we need in the real world to solve them .
but in fact , my research , the center for the future that , is the opposite accurate .

indeed , i am convinced that , if we get the next century on this planet to survive to , we this time to dramatically increase need .
i 've calculated that the time in 21 billion hours to play a week is .
it appears first maybe something <unk> , so again , i it , so there are still ca : if we problems like hungry , poverty , climate change , global conflict and obesity want to solve , i think , we need to try to play online for more of 21 billion hours per week ago to end of the next decade to play .
no , i mean it really seriously .
why ? this picture is pretty sure , why i believe that play , so critical for survival of the human species in the future are . seriously .
this is the picture of photographers <unk> <unk> .
he wanted to the feelings to play catch . so he of the players have a camera around .
this is one of the classical music had to play .
if you do n't want gamers are , we think , you may be some of nuances in this picture .
they 're probably this sense of urgency , a fear , but also very antithesis of concentration , it would one in this is , one really tough problem .
if you can play , you see some of nuances . here , the up <unk> eyes and the mouth is an indication about optimism . the present to show us .
this is a gamer , the edge of so-called were of tension .
oh , you know that . ok , neat . so we have some outstanding players here .
a <unk> the force is a result , that goes extremely positive is that they were n't even knew that it was possible .
it was almost go beyond the imagination .
and if you do it , they 're shocked me that they actually going to something that are able to . this is a <unk> victory .
these gamer is just before you were to defeat .
and this is it , what we on millions of their faces of service on the world 's what we need , when we brought about the next century in and figure take . the face of those , the contrary of reverence and against the edge of were of stand .
well , unfortunately , we see more like this face in real life , if we difficult problems facing .
i sometimes it as `` in life , i 'm sick '' <unk> . and it 's actually my face , you see ? yes , ok .
this is me , and i found that `` in life , i 'm sick '' <unk> do .
this is a graffiti on my former head home at berkley , california where i live in my ph.d. studying how we in games are better than the real life .
this is an issue that many of gamers have .
we think that we in reality is not so well , how to play .
and i 'm not just a successful , although it to hear anything .
we reach into <unk> more . i mean , in the case the motivation , something meaningful to do , inspired to work with each other .
if we were in a <unk> are , i believe that many of us to our best story into , anytime and immediately be willing , been the problem of trying , as long necessary , it after the failure , again and try .
and in reality , if we fail , if we went on the barriers are colliding , feel we often different .
we feel overwhelmed . we feel from depression . we feel threatened , may be depressed , frustrated when you get .
these feelings , we 've never , if we play games , in games are they simply not .
and this is it , what i as a phd for is really wanted .
why is it into play an impossible , to think , you could n't everything to achieve ?
how we can these feelings of the play in the reality right ?
so i looked at play like the world of warcraft , that the ideal world to collaborative solving is .
and i have some things i realized , the epic victories of <unk> so we can do .
so , first , if you into one of games can get , of the world of warcraft , there 's a lot of characters , who are willing , you a <unk> mission <unk> , which is immediately .
but not just some justice mission , but a mission that are perfectly to her current level of the game , which is , right ?
so , they make it .
they have never a project that you ca n't solve .
and to the edge of their skills , so you want to try better . but it 's no unemployment in the world of warcraft .
you is not around and turns around six . there are always completely in some important to do .
and there are tons of staff .
where they also go , hundreds of people that with them together , to entangle his epic mission of business .
that we have in real life , not so easy , that feeling that in a <unk> tons of staff who willingly stand .
and there 's this epic story , this inspiring story , why we 're there and what we have to deal .
then we can get this whole positive feedback .
they 've driven by `` level up '' and `` plus-one strength , '' or heard `` plus-one intelligence .
this constant , and what we 're not there in real life .
if i want to the stage was leaving , i did not , is plus-one talking and plus-one crazy idea , <unk> crazy idea .
i get in real life that feedback , not .
so , the problem <unk> like the world of warcraft , it gratifying it is , anytime , the edge of were of to stand out that we prefer our whole time in these <unk> spend .
they 're just better than the reality .
to have all the world of <unk> together <unk> million years , so i spent , the virtual problems of <unk> to solve .
this is not necessarily bad things .
it might sound bad .
but to put this time in the context to see , of <unk> million years of our first <unk> up to go .
the first of walking a so .
ok , so if we talk about , how much time we currently going to play spend , does that 's a sense , when you to the time in terms of the scale of human development of eyes are holding , what the fact is .
but also be appropriate . because it turns out that we , if we all of this time to play using , actually changing this , what we be able to are .
we 're going to each other folks , thank beings .
this is the truth . because i believe .
so look at this interesting , who recently renovated by a researcher on the carnegie mellon university was published , the average young man of today in a country with potent <unk> spend 10,000 hours with <unk> to the 21st century . 12 .
so , 10,000 hours , is a very interesting number , from two reasons .
first of , for children in the united states is <unk> hours of the exact <unk> that you in school to spend , of the five . grade to finish the high school -- if you never been missing .
so we have here a complete <unk> , on the young people together , what it means , a good poker player to be , like everything else , what you in school to learn .
and may have some of the new book of malcolm gladwell , `` <unk> '' , read .
so you know of his theory of success , the theory of success of 10,000 hours .
it builds on the great things that led to the <unk> that , if we scraped 10,000 hours with that study of any matter to the 21st century . , spend , we 're going to the one-to-infinite amount of it .
we 're so good at , whatever it to do , like the most important people the world .
so , what we have here , is a whole generation of young people that <unk> are .
the big question is so `` what exactly are the player 's really good ? ''
because if you go out how could , if we have to sort of that i 've ever since <unk> human potential to draw .
so many people have we currently in the world that looked at an hour a day with <unk> spend .
these are our <unk> . 500 million people that an exceptionally good in `` something '' are .
and the next decade we have another one billion players , the exceptionally good in whatever it 's .
if you could n't even heard ,
that 's going on the kind of <unk> , the energy savings and on <unk> work , instead of the <unk> , so players around the world , especially in india , china , brazil , online can play .
you 're expecting an extra one billion player in the next decade .
so we 've come to 1.5 million players .
so i started , to think , what it is , where we have these games to mastery .
here is the four things that i found . so first , <unk> .
ok , you to imagine that as the extreme <unk> ago .
<unk> is the desire , immediately to be done , a challenge to mastery , together with the believe that we get it 's hope to succeed you have .
players are always that a <unk> the force is possible , and that it always be worth , it to try , which is the same .
just are not sit around .
are experts in spiders poet of social networks .
it 's a lot more interesting discussion , the show that we people more like , after we 're going to play , even if they were necessary evil from depression have .
the reason is that it 's a lot of trust yourself , with somebody a game to play .
we rely on that somebody out with us to spend that the rules would be that we the same spot , and to the game , you 're going .
so what allows this interaction between the growing of you might have , trust and reciprocally .
as a result of it 's create a stronger form social relations in .
<unk> productivity . fantastic .
you know , there 's a reason , why the <unk> of <unk> 22 hours per week is , sort of as <unk> .
the reason is that , if we play , we are actually become happier and , hard to work , as if we relax , or doing nothing .
we know that we as human beings can work , if we 're stiff , great lengths to do .
and are always ready , hard to work , if you the right over here .
and ultimately , epic , meaning .
players love it , part of the buddha <unk> missions <unk> critical to be .
now let me <unk> , and the right light to do that . you 've been looking at all of wikipedia , the greatest on wiki the world .
the second wiki the world , with very much has 80,000 entries that is the world of warcraft wiki .
five million people use it every month .
they have more information about the world of warcraft the native americans than about some other issue in each other wiki the world .
they 're creating a epic story .
they 're creating a epic source of knowledge about the world of warcraft .
ok , so there are four superpowers , the to one thing , are <unk> , hopeful way of individuals .
there are people , who believe that it as a single change the world can .
and the only problem is that they believe , you can the virtual worlds to change , but not the real .
this is the issue that i of doing trials .
edward <unk> is a <unk> .
his work is great . he studies , why people that much time , energy and money in <unk> spend .
and he says , `` we 'll account of nothing less than a <unk> in virtual worlds , and <unk> . ''
and that by an economist . so he 's obvious .
and he goes ...
not like i -- i emission , games , i 'm a <unk> .
so he says , the result is actually make sense , because the player can in <unk> achieve more than the real life .
you can into play a stronger form an have with each other than the real life . they get more force feedback and the rewards in games than the real life .
so , he says , it 's currently , perfectly reasonable that are more time in the virtual world as in the real spend .
i 'm only time to that 's logical .
but it 's definitely not <unk> .
we need to start , the real world in a game to turn into .
my whole inspiration comes from an event , the 2,500 years ago .
there are these scripts cube , from <unk> . you know ?

and they were sort of the first of people were <unk> .
and if you are to work of the ancient greek the historian <unk> 're familiar , you know , maybe this story . the story about how , and why games come up being .
according <unk> were playing , specifically <unk> , in the kingdom <unk> as a famine invented .
we think there was such a great famine , that the king of <unk> to a crazy idea of .
the people who suffered none . the people fought side .
it was an extreme situation . you needed an extraordinary way .
so they invented , according <unk> that <unk> and literally a national energy strategy . on a day would you eat . the next day you would play .
and they would as much in the <unk> would be given that play , so fascinating , and us with more , <unk> productivity , surrounded by that you remember , it not to eat it was .
and then , the next day you would play . and the next day would you eat .
and according <unk> allowed you like 18 years of these great famine , putting them on a day eating and the next was playing .
likewise , i think , we 're going to play a .
we 're playing a , to the suffering from the real world to escape .
we 're playing a , for all due to avoid that in the real world 's not work , especially in the real life 's not quite gratifying it is , and we get us what we need from the play .
but it does n't have been the .
that 's exciting .
according <unk> was to 18 years , the famine , not better . so i decided to the king , one last <unk> scale-up .
they did the realm into two contest .
they played a <unk> and the winner got to a were exploring of familiarity .
they come <unk> and got to the lookout for a new home . they were just so many people back , like this food to survive , and looking at the rest for an area , where they are able to .
it sounds crazy , right ?

so , scientists recently the notion that <unk> 's crazy story actually true .
and we geologists found evidence of global cooling of that almost 20 years before , what the famine tell you could .
so i could take these crazy story of voices .
you may have in their people through play rescued , because they turned 18 years of in games , escaped , and then this intuition , and so much about that playing with each learned that it really the whole civilization have saved .
so that we can also .
we 're playing around since 1994 warcraft .
it was the first <unk> in real the world of <unk> . that was 16 years before .
they were at 18 years of <unk> , we 're playing around for 16 years of warcraft .
i say , we 're ready for our own epic game .
so , they sent the latter part of civilization depended on the lookout for a new world . so suppose i mean , 21 billion <unk> per week .
we should look at the aarhus convention that half of us an hour a day to play spend , until we the problems with the real world have solved .
i know , they 're asking : `` how we 're solving problems of the real world in games ? '' and this question i have my work in recent years , the center for the spirit .
we have this banner , in our office in palo alto , it back out how we the future that should .
we do n't want to try , the future , to say .
what we want , is the future of law .
we want to the best thing you imagine . and then people to leverage , this idea in the reality of doing it .
we imagine epic victories of and give people the ways that you to do .
i 'll show you very short half-life , games that i 've designed to try , people that epic victories in their own futures into space instantaneously .
this is `` the world without oil . ''
this game is in 2007 .


we have this game with <unk> players in 2007 , and tested . and we have you ever since over the last three already carrying .
and i can tell you , it was changing the experience .
nobody wants to life change , because it 's good for the environment , or because we should .
but if you in a were to those adventures are and told you get , `` we are the oil . ''
this is an amazing man , on that you go .
they find out , as you survive , it . the most of gamers have the game <unk> habits and calculated .
so we 've used for the next <unk> play a bigger , higher purpose of maths than just <unk> .
we have this game , `` <unk> '' the center for the future .
starting point is that calculation of <unk> that the people 's 23 years on planet going to have .
of supercomputers -- is called global <unk> <unk> '' , of course .
the call to players , to sign up , we have almost like a `` <unk> '' <unk> perspective .
you know the jerry <unk> , where it `` <unk> '' is . they have the astronaut , the scientists , the <unk> and all together , you can save the world .
but in your game , instead of only five million people , we say , everybody 's in <unk> , and it 's our job , the future for energy , food , health , security and the future of social justice to create .
8,000 people are played this game was five weeks of .
they found out 500 incredibly creative solutions that you but , if you , `` <unk> '' google .
and the last game , we take the three . march out . it 's a game in collaboration with the world .
if you this game to conclude , preserving them from the world bank , the distinction , `` social <unk> , '' the end by 2010 .
we 're working with the universities all over africa , and they invite one , social construct our everyday to learn .
we have a striped cartoon on this . we have `` level up '' for <unk> understand , <unk> , sustainability , vision and ingenuity .
i want you all like , this game with young people to share , all around the world , especially in <unk> , the of us , along their own social enterprises , to imagine , the world to save .
i come up the end .
i want you some questions .
what , you think that happens next for ?
we have all these fantastic players , we have games that show us , what we can do , but we have the real world 's not be saved .
well , i hope that you me to agree that are human resources are that we to work in real life , in , and games to a big meaning for transformation has .
we 've all these superpowers , <unk> productivity , the ability , strong social networks to knit , <unk> and the craving for <unk> meaning .
i 'm really that we launched a significant play games , on this planet 's another one century to survive .
and i hope that you 're going to me like to play a design and play .
if i the next decade <unk> , i 'm at two things sure , that we 're pumping <unk> future can create , and that we all kinds of play games can .
so i say , let the <unk> 'll start !
thanks .
i 'd like to something about , what i 'm a few months to write an article for <unk> wired noticed is .
i have to write and my <unk> fingertips , but i was going to fill prescriptions of really prefer are already done , and i fell on that i never had in my life <unk> , what the word `` the disabled , '' really means .
and i read them to post .

<unk> : well , strong , powerful . ''
i have this list of a friend , according to and i had once you laugh , it was so ridiculous , but i was just to be beaten up '' and i could no longer <unk> , and had to stop to read and i first year after this <unk> <unk> and the so <unk> of shock .
so of this was a <unk> , old <unk> . i 've got me just thought that the copy it 's very old to be .
but actually it was a copy in the early 1980s , as i have on the school actually started and so began , my model of the outside of the family sphere to build and to form , even in terms of other children and the way , the world around me .
and thank you have i did n't <unk> used .
i 'd like this post take seriously , i would go in a world was born , that someone like me as a person who avail ourselves would , whose lives in <unk> a positive or flatter can . today , but i 'm going to the probability and adventure , and i 've experienced , celebrated .
so i immediately overloaded the <unk> of 2009 , directly and expecting that i here a <unk> contribution to me .

unfortunately , it 's not much better .

but it 's not only about the words .
it 's about , what you over the people think that we do with these words .
it 's about the values , the inside these words stuck , and as those values , .
our language affects our thinking , and as the world and the people around us see .
many <unk> societies , including the greek and the roman , really believed that the <unk> one <unk> a great force , because that , what you do <unk> , to be <unk> can .
so , what we want to actually <unk> -- a <unk> people or a powerful people ?
just been a human <unk> as a child to call , could be enough , you the atmosphere and you have <unk> .
it would n't beautiful , you doors to open up ?
a person , the for me and doors to open , was my pediatrician in the <unk> . and dupont , the institute in <unk> in <unk> .
he 's dr. <unk> . a <unk> , whose name , what they can imagine , the most americans do n't labeled the financials tell you could . so he became increasingly , dr. p. called .
and dr. p. was always very colorful , fly and it 's for the work with kids , just like crazy .
i thought this time that i think in that hospital , i have spent , just great -- the way on my <unk> .
i had one practice to be forever , to repeat anything to the obese , <unk> <unk> -- in different colors -- that you know , to my <unk> build . and i have this on down to really hated them than anything else . i 've you . i have you 're haunted . i 've you .
and so now , before , i whistled even when <unk> kid with dr. p. negotiate and so i tried , this practice to stop , <unk> no success .
and one day he ended up at one of my favorite exercises at -- that includes exercises they were just really tiring and -- mercilessly -- and he said to me , `` wow , aimee , you go , such a strong , incredibly powerful and young girl , you 're going one day one of cut apart .
and if you live there are , i give you a hundred dollars . ''
it was obviously just a lot easier to move from dr. p. so that i the exercises that i do that i 'm not to do , with the prospect that the richest five-year-old kid in the ward in the second third floor to be . but he had me in this room , my daily <unk> with new eyes to see . so , it became a new and <unk> experience .
and i wonder now , how much of his vision of me as strong and incredibly young girl with my model of shaped , and i so imagine , me as one of nature of the strong , powerful and <unk> to see .
it 's just an example of many people , as adults into <unk> the imagination that 's imaginations , .
but how the been quoted examples from the <unk> prove that makes us our language , no room , something to imagine , what we all want you would have it , every single the place , to themselves as powerful people to see .

the medical contribution from outer space you can kind of that tell my legs , the <unk> for <unk> , <unk> of titanium or artificial <unk> for the aging body , and allow people , really all their opportunities to use and out about the limits that you your natural to figure out , in addition to develop , did n't have to talk about social <unk> platforms , people have a personal identity involves giving , to own way , and then disseminate it is that , and itself with the world to groups of economics , and they come to choose .
maybe that 's so this technological change clearly , because i 've heard that it 's always been a different truth gave , which is that every man of society , something very <unk> and very incredibly can give and that the human ability , to adapt , our biggest plus is .
the human ability to adapt yourself -- this is an interesting story , because people to me again and ask to tell , like me to be <unk> and i 'm going to a confession to , that sentence , to me never <unk> and i was always very uncomfortable with it felt that question of people to answer , and i think , gradually i understanding why .
this phrase uttered by interacting with be living off the idea that success or fortunately it depends on , a challenge to mastery , without talking about it down to experience that to be . as if my life so successful order to be , because i could be possible to fall of life with a prosthetic limb of the way , or how the people to me with my disability to perceive .
but the truth is that we change . so we are of the challenge that , we asked them physically , emotionally , or even the two is
and i claim that 's good .
and against are no impediment , that we <unk> need to get around with our lives better clear to come .
and against belong to our lives .
and i tend to , and against perceived as my shadow like to see .
sometimes with me i that he really present , sometimes it 's hard to see , but he 's constantly morphing with me .
and i want to look at all the impact , or . the face of <unk> of people , defenses .
there are in life be adversities , and challenges , and they are just <unk> real and each person is it differently about . but the question is not , whether we 're going to be clear , or not , but how we realize sound coming .
so we 're not just responsible for that people who we love , of <unk> to maintain , but they also to prepare , well , so clear to come .
and we change our kids do n't like , if we do you feel that give that they do n't fit can .
you have two things you 're separated , to the medical fact , an amputee , to and for the social think about , i be disabled , or not .
and in fact be , the only real and we 're being disabled , with the i just sit down to , is that the world changing , says , you know me to the definitions .
in our desire , the people to protect , the us on the heart of you and you the cold , hard to the truth about their medical sort of `` to communicate or even a forecast the quality to imagine that you expect , we have an operation that we 're not the ground for the speech that somebody actually a matter is .
maybe it 's the current policy , the only to pay attention , what 's in a broken , and how we live to fix , for every single one more of disability than the pathology , in .
if we have a single person 's not holistically and treat , and not all its power and opportunity to perceive and recognized , we do in addition to the natural fight , the you might lead to , one another disease .
we <unk> a human , the for our society , a value is .
so let 's about the <unk> look out and us on all of the human possibility to focus .
the most important , but this is that it between the perception of our shortcomings in our great human ingenuity , a connection is .

i 'm might be worried about , suffice to imagine that we be not necessarily need to get to , but that we started to open , you to hug , and make it really seize to put to be a <unk> to use , maybe even with it to dance .
and maybe we do it , and against perceived as a natural , coherent and useful to see , and we feel so through their presence n't like that tools .
in this year , celebrate it 's the 200 . birthday of charles darwin and when he said to 150 years of evolution has written , did darwin , in my eyes , on something very true in the human nature that you .
i would play this tradition , not the most of its kind of abuse , and also not the <unk> its way , but the , the to change the best fit can .
in conflict , creativity .

so , again , change and adjusting these are the great skills of people .
and maybe we know it , out of wood and we <unk> are , if we really acumen and will .
maybe this is that the point of be adversities , a sense of myself , a sense of our own power .
we can be so even a gift .
we can be a new meaning to that over difficult times beyond what 's about .
maybe we can be able to see the change .
and against stand for a change , at the we had n't have adapted .
i think , the biggest impact , the we are of it , is to believe that we normally , should be .
let 's face -- who is normal ?
there is not normal .
there 's the usual . the typical . but not the normal . and they would those poor , in person who really know how we want , if they really there ?
i think , to .
it would be great , if we have this paradigm of normality , fighting another one of options , or the strength , about it even a little bit dangerous to math exercises , exchange itself . so we can the forces of a very many kids who release , and you know , to invite men , their very particular , and great skills in the society itself .
<unk> have found that we humans from the members of our societies collapse every one by , useful to be , and a contributor to afford .

they have these people not as a broken and ineffective in them ; they were considered anything special , and infatuation do with treatment .
a few years , i went in the city , where i grew up , in a <unk> in the `` the red zone . '' in the northeast of pennsylvania , and i was there was actually a <unk> used .
it was the summer , and i had <unk> on .
and i am , like a guy behind me say , `` well , if that 's not aimee mullins , is . ''
and i turn me around and i see the elderly gentleman . i had no idea who he is .
and i said , `` sorry , sir , we know us ? i ca n't want to you remember . ''
and he said , `` well , you probably do n't change to me remind .

oh , so the .
and of this , then , but i click .
this is dr. <unk> , a man , the i just like narratives of my mother about this day i knew , because i of course , quite typical , to my birthday , two weeks , too late afternoon , .
the doctor to have been diagnostics of my mother was on holiday , and so i knew my parents of the man , the me to the world 's that , at all .
and because i did n't <unk> was born , and my feet to me to ivan , and i just toes , at this and a couple of your toes , the other foot , it was the <unk> , of strangers to the bad news <unk> .
he said to me , `` i had to your parents says , you never going would , and not such mobile be would like the other children or you never an independent life , if you could , and since they broke me simply lying <unk> . ''
really exceptional , i found that he <unk> my entire childhood , thus , however , i be true of the <unk> in the second grade , won , i be with the <unk> the kind of the <unk> which was , however , i be my transplant fellowship , or one of <unk> victories <unk> , and he used these clips to get around the students to teach , <unk> from the <unk> medical school and the <unk> medical school .
and he mentioned that part of his <unk> the x is a factor , the potential of human , willing .
you ca n't enough to emphasize , how critical of a factor for the quality of people can be .
and dr. <unk> told them , he said , `` i 've learned that children , if you do n't have something else said , and even if you just little support , if you kids , even leaves , then you can teach kids , very much for . ''
you see , dr. <unk> has to be thinking of changes .
he had understood that the medical diagnosis , and how someone with hundred-dollar devices , two different things are .
and i quit my thinking over the the time has changed , if you me the age of 15 years , `` have , if i 'm wearing them to rebuilding of meat and bone , avatars or , then i would not a second <unk> .
i wanted to be at the normal work .
if you me that today , i 'm not so sure .
and that 's happening , because i do with my legs 've experienced and not in spite of these experiences .
and perhaps could this change that we also happen , because i so many people come up , the me the doors to open , instead of people to meet that i cut , or me an idea that they impose to .
you see , it takes a really just a human , of them short , as you get their powers <unk> , and they 're going through .
if you to enable , his own , inner power to activate , -- the human mind is so <unk> -- if you do that , and for people in a critical moment a door swings open , then they 're looking for these people a very good teachers .
they bring them in , to the doors to open .
the real importance of the word `` <unk> '' is rooted in the word `` <unk> .
it means , a novel that in this is , the potential <unk> .
again , what the potential to it 's because now in there ?
in the late 1950s was in the u.k. <unk> pittsburgh . when they were <unk> in <unk> transformed .
they call that there , `` <unk> <unk> '' in the united states , we call the term `` <unk> .
the challenge is going to the grades .
and the a student will <unk> more ethics , the better teacher , etc .
they have on a three of students with a `` well enough , '' the note , very good '' gave them . it was taken them said , they were <unk> that you very clever would . and after these three months , they really <unk> written .
and of it 'll it 's the heart to hear that way around the <unk> was told , they were just have enough .
and as it was then after the three months , too .
but only ones that still in school were -- aside from the students , the school for whatever they had .
very crucial in this trial was that the teachers wo n't <unk> were .
the teachers who did n't know that something changed was .
they were just told that 's the student and that are the students with the note would have enough . and as you have you something about teaching and you moron .
the only real sense of disability is a <unk> mind is a spirit , the broken , has no hope that . he finds no more beautiful . it 's our natural , child-survival , curiosity . and our innate capacity to the minotaur .
if we but do , the human spirit in order to support , continue to hope , and other people around it 's nice to find , inquisitive and <unk> to be then we 're using our power is really being a .
if a spirit of these qualities , then we can be a new reality and new <unk> create .

come , dance with me . thank you .
